After a year of cautious caretaker rule by technocrats since massive street protests over the deaths of 64 people in a Bucharest nightclub fire forced the former PSD regime from power, the dominant party of Romanian politics has topped all recent polls. But a new party, the Save Romania Union (USR), founded barely six months ago to fight the corruption, cronyism and inefficiency endemic in Romanian public life since the overthrow of the Ceauescu dictatorship in 1989, could spoil the celebrations.  Related: 'I voted for a safe choice': readers on the Romanian election  Polls have credited the USR, led by the mathematician and former civic activist Nicuor Dan, with between 8% and 19% of the vote, which could make it the junior partner in a new coalition with the centre-right PNL, on 18-27%, perhaps lined up behind the outgoing caretaker prime minister, Dacian Ciolo. A survey last week put the Social Democrats  who have governed the country in assorted coalitions for 17 of the 27 years since the fall of communism  on 43% of the national vote, with their liberal ALDE allies on 6%. PSD, which has promised to boost social spending and reintroduce progressive taxation in place of an unpopular flat-rate income tax, won more than half the posts in Junes mayoral elections in towns and villages around the country, and has a clear organisational advantage. They are an extremely powerful political machine, said one analyst, Cristian Ptrconiu. They have half the mayors in Romania, three-quarters of the county councils, and a robust structure of power across the country. PSD had already begun reversing hugely unpopular austerity programmes before it was forced to resign in October last year after being blamed for the years of official graft and inaction that many Romanians felt lay behind the nightclub fire. Romania, an enthusiastic EU member for a decade and a major recipient of EU funds, remains one of Europes most corrupt countries: a report by the IPP thinktank last week found that of the 588 MPs elected at the last poll in 2012, 89  or 15%  were either under investigation for graft, had already been convicted, or chose to step down for other positions.  Related: Book 'em: the loophole undermining Romania's anti-corruption drive  Whichever party wins on Sunday must walk a budgetary tightrope. Romanias economy is growing strongly at about 5% year on year, but average take-home pay is low at barely 420 (353) a month.  The incoming government will need to find a way to balance an urgent need for investment in neglected infrastructure against huge popular pressure for increases to wages and pensions.  Ciolo, a former EU agriculture commissioner who has led the countrys technocratic government for the past 12 months, told Reuters last month that the next government should first approve a new public sector wage scheme aimed at evening out major inequalities and raising average wages by 34%. Other top priorities were encouraging young Romanian medical graduates to stay in the country (there are now more Romanian doctors in France than in Romania), and encouraging teachers and other public sector employees to move to some of the countrys most disadvantaged areas, Ciolo said.  The PSD leader, Liviu Dragnea, has said he plans to prepare 200 state-owned companies for privatisation, boost the national minimum wage, introduce tax incentives for families whose children attend school regularly, and invest heavily in the national health service, including a big new teaching hospital in Bucharest and eight new regional centres.  But Ciolo warned all parties against making unsustainable promises that he said would inevitably end up increasing voter resentment and fuelling populism. Many parties are making some of the same economic policy proposals and promises they made four, eight years ago that have not been enforced, he said. It is clear they are unrealistic proposals that aim to get peoples attention and votes. In the future, parties need to do more to boost the trust of voters who want Romanian society and institutions to reform. Dan, a 46-year-old mathematician and conservation activist turned party leader, hopes Sundays parliamentary elections will represent a turning point for the countrys political scene.  Polls suggest his USR party could take a significant share of the vote, its message of greater governmental accountability and transparency striking a chord in a country beset by political scandals, corruption and a lack of confidence in traditional parties. The party is tiny  it has just 15 paid staff and a few thousand volunteers  but has big ambitions. We believe we can be kingmakers, Dan told the Guardian recently. If not, we will be the opposition.  Related: Reclaiming the streets ... for cars? Why Bucharest is reining in outdoor events  The mathematics researcher at the Romanian Academy, whose profile has risen on the back of regular TV and media appearances, has twice run for mayor of Bucharest. In 2012, Dan stood as an independent on a narrow platform of preserving historic buildings and defending green spaces from urban developers, winning 8.5% of the vote. This year, as the head of a party he founded called the Save Bucharest Union, and running on a broader anti-corruption platform, he finished second with more than 30% of the vote. The USR, whose candidates include academics, people from the private sector and a handful of former ministers, hopes to provide a strong new political voice. This is the first authentic grassroots movement that has the chance to breach parliament, said Tudor Benga, an e-commerce entrepreneur and USR candidate for the Transylvanian city of Brasov.  They can get seats, said Alina Mungiu-Pippidi, a Romanian political scientist, who thinks 10% is an attainable target. There is sheer desperation among many voters. People dont know USR, but there is an anti-system mood in Romania and people are willing to overlook the makeshift nature of the party. The party says it intends to back Ciolo, the independent politician who took over as interim prime minister in November 2015, and the partys success in part depends on this gamble. We could have a selfish approach, saying we are against all other political parties, that they are all corrupt and the same, which theyre not, and we could probably get more seats, said Dan, who balances charisma with the cautious studiousness of an academic. Supporting Ciolo would lead to the best outcome for Romania, he added. We cant compete with the main parties at the level of structure, thats obvious, but there has been a wait for a change in society, and I think we are the party [people] have been waiting for, he said.

In a major new report, the National Infrastructure Commission said the UK is being held back by poor mobile phone connectivity, as it called for an end to digital deserts in places that should have adequate signals such as rail routes, roads and city centres. Countries including the US and Japan already have data volumes four to five higher than the UK, the report found.  The commission, chaired by Andrew Adonis, the crossbench peer and former Labour minister, said the government must now ensure that the next generation of 5G spectrum does not have the failures that dog 4G coverage. Britain is 54th in the world for 4G coverage, and the typical user can only access 4G barely half the time, Adonis said. Our 4G network is worse than Romania and Albania, Panama and Peru. Our roads and railways can feel like digital deserts and even our city centres are plagued by not spots where connectivity is impossible.  That isnt just frustrating, it is increasingly holding British business back as more and more of our economy requires a connected workforce. In a list of recommendations, it argued there should be a new dedicated cabinet minister in charge of the UKs digital future, ensuring mobile connectivity is competitive with the rest of the world.  On top of that, it called for ministers and Ofcom, the media regulator, to work together to ensure a set of standards known as a universal service obligation no later than 2025. The crucial priorities for coverage are key rail routes, major roads such as motorways and all towns and cities, Adonis said.  5G is the future  ultra-fast and ultra-reliable, it has the potential to change our lives and our economy in ways we cannot even imagine today. But the UK is currently languishing in the digital slow lane, he added.  5G offers us a chance to start again and get ahead. If government acts now we can ensure our major transport networks and urban centres are 5G ready in time to give British industry every chance to lead the world in exploiting its applications. But none of this will matter unless we bring our mobile network up to speed. The existing system does not provide the level of coverage we will need in our connected future. We need a new universal service obligation which ensures that the mobile essentials  like text, talk and data  are available to us wherever we need them. Grant Shapps, the former Tory chairman who now leads the British Infrastructure Group of MPs, said the report should be a wakeup call for the government, as he accused them of being too willing to listen to the excuses of mobile phone operators about poor signal. This confirms what we have been saying for a long time. Over the years, ministers have been far too easy on the glib promises given by the telecoms providers and I think that has been combined with ineffective and weak regulation from Ofcom, Shapps said.  Britain cannot afford to repeat the outcome of the 5G network that we have had with the 4G network and so the British Infrastructure is calling on the prime minister to appoint a cabinet minister to oversee the recommendations of this report and make sure this person is accountable for delivering 5G throughout the UK.   Related: UK 4G coverage is worse than in Peru. We need a minister for the internet | Charles Arthur  Unfortunately there has been a very long history of believing what the telecoms companies say rather than questioning it. The fact the report was commissioned is a good thing but Britain should be all about infrastructure in this post-Brexit world and here is a real wake-up call to make sure it actually happens this time. The National Infrastructure Commission was established last year by George Osborne, the then chancellor, to advise the government on critical challenges related to the UKs networks such as transport, telecommunications, energy and utilities. 5G networks are not expected to become available until 2020 but Ofcom has already begun preparations for auctioning off the spectrum. The round of 4G auctions raised less than Osborne had hoped for in 2012 and much of the UK is still plagued with not spots of poor signal. In a recent report backed by 90 MPs from all parties, the British Infrastructure Group proposed an amendment to the governments digital economy bill to allow Ofcom to fine mobile operators that did not meet the targets of a 2014 agreement.  That deal gave the four large network operators (MNOs) another chance to fix mobile not spots after they said they would pump 5bn into improving coverage across the UK by December 2017 in return for the government not pursuing a system of national roaming. BIG said it found little evidence to suggest that the mobile sector would meet the targets of this agreement to provide coverage to 90% of the UKs geographic area, and called for a progress update to be published by the end of 2016."

Romania - doughty against France in the opening match of the tournament - conceded just two goals in the qualifiers but in their last five competitive fixtures have scored just five goals (three of them against Faroe Islands, one of them from the penalty spot against France). Switzerland, for their part, made a very good start against Albania, scoring inside the first five minutes, then struggled to keep it up for the rest of the match. So, what we<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>ve got here is: team who defend well but don<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>t score very much v team that struggled to score against minnows.<br></p> <p>That said, Switzerland <em>should </em>score. Just look at the talent available to them. Granit Xhaka is a maestro, Xherdan Shaqiri has scored four and made five goals in his last eight competitive matches. At some point, surely the team have to live up their perennial tag of dark horses and go on a run. Victory here would mean they would be the first team to go into the knockout stages. </p> <p>There are a few ructions in their squad at the moment though: Shaqiri has threatened to ditch Switzerland for the newly Uefa-recognised Kosovo, particularly if the side offer him the captaincy that Switzerland have not. He<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>s been doing his bit for team morale <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jun/14/euro-2016-xherdan-shaqiri-switzerland-romania"">by talking about that in the buildup</a> to this match which is good of him.</p> <p><strong>Romania will be set up to frustrate and perhaps rightly so.</strong> A draw here, then victory over Albania could well see them safely into the knockout stages as one of the best third-placed teams. Their coach, Anghel Iordanescu has just about said as much too: <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><c5><93>We have to be realistic; we have to understand that we<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>ll be playing against a very good side. Their 23 players play in big leagues like the Bundesliga. Our objective is to qualify from the group.<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><c2><9d> Romania took confidence from their performance against France, despite their disappointment <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/jun/10/france-romania-euro-2016-live"">at conceding a late Dimitri Payet winner</a>, and they will be determined not to lose this one too. </p> <p>There is some historic needle to the match too. These two teams met in their second match at the 1994 World Cup finals when, under Roy Hodgson, the Swiss beat Romania 4-1 in Detroit. Romania recovered to win the group and went through to the quarter finals (<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/1994/jul/04/worldcup2006.sport"">courtesy of the delicious Hagi</a>), though, and Switzerland went home in the round of 16. Three years earlier, Romania beat Switzerland in qualifying for Euro 92, meaning they failed to qualify for the tournament and Scotland got in. So that<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>s some 22 year old needle right there. </p> <p>Let<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>s enjoy Romania at the 1994 World Cup all over again, courtesy of Rob Smyth via the link below:</p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/jan/22/joy-of-six-counterattacking-goals"">The Joy of Six: Counter-attacking goals</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2016-06-15T14:52:24.144Z"">at 3.52pm BST</time></p>  </div>",2016," 7.15pm BST Heres the match report from the game:  Related: Admir Mehmedi crashes home to rescue point for Switzerland against Romania   6.53pm BST Thats it from me. Join Jacob Steinberg for all the action from France v Albania here (where Pogba and Griezmann have been dropped):  Related: France v Albania: Euro 2016  live!  Updated at 6.59pm BST  6.52pm BST Well, Switzerland were disappointing there. For a team with such potential, they looked blunt in attack - though Embolo was certainly an upgrade on Seferovic - and short of ideas in midfield, where Xhaka and Shaqiri failed to shine. Romania achieved exactly what they set out to achieve: not to lose. Thats a first point on the board for them and a win over Albania could see them into the knock-outs. See all the permutations here:  Related: Euro 2016 interactive wallchart: groups, fixtures, venues and more  Updated at 7.01pm BST  6.50pm BST Xhaka finds Embolo, who runs at the Romania defence. In his desperation to find an opening, he bulldozes Grigore and earns a yellow card. And that, more or less, is that. Full time.  6.49pm BST 90 min +2: Xhaka lifts a free kick to Land on the left wing, who sends a cross into the area. Goal kick. A minute to go.  6.48pm BST 90 min: Keseru wriggles and twists in the centre of the pitch, desperately trying to hang onto the ball and to keep it from marauding Swiss midfielders. Hes clipped to the ground when the marauding Swiss midfield get sick of that sort of thing. Shaqiri is hauled off - and has been a bit disappointing - Evertons Tarashaj replaces him. Three minutes added time.  6.45pm BST 88 min: Lichsteiner and Lang combine very neatly up the Swiss left wing. Lang clips a good cross into the area that would have destined for Embolos head and, then, the back of the neck had Tatarusanu not climbed well to claim.  6.44pm BST 87 min: Schar concedes a corner and Romania send forward a fair few men. Theyre not taking this draw yet. Chiriches jumps but a Swiss defender beats him to the ball, a good solid clearance.  6.42pm BST 85 min: Free kick to Switzerland 20 metres outside the Romania box. Rodriguez lifts the ball in, the Swiss big men pile in to get on the end of it, Romania clear it with ease. For anyone concerned about the Germany managers nether regions:  Related: Joachim Lw says sorry for causing a stir with scratch and sniff   6.41pm BST 84 min: Lichsteiner, who has pushed forward now that Lang is playing right back, plays a nice ball into Embolo. The Swiss striker leans on Grigore ever so delicately and the Romanian defender hits the deck. Hmm. Updated at 6.48pm BST  6.40pm BST 83 min: For Switzerland, Lang replaces Dzemaili to bolster the Swiss defence. For Romania, Stancu - who has just take a knock - is replaced by Andone.  6.37pm BST 80 min: That said, Hoban plays an incisive ball into Torje in the Swiss area. All he had to do was trap it and shoot, but his touch is very heavy and Romania concede possession. They look tired and are struggling even more than normal to keep hold of the ball.  6.35pm BST 78 min: Perhaps chastened by that volley, Dzemaili opts not to shoot when he finds himself with the ball in the D. He attempts a pass to Shaqiri but the Romania defence clear. Switzerland are all over Romania at the moment, with the Romanians puffing hard.  6.34pm BST 76 min: Shaqiri blasts the free kick into the wall, it bounces back for Mehmedi, and he wafts a tame shot at Tatarusanu. A moment or two later, Dzemaili attempts to lash a first time volley at goal from a ball ballooned over his head. The result is not pretty. His manager stands on the touchline shaking his head ruefully. Updated at 6.44pm BST  6.32pm BST 75 min: Grigore flattens Embolo just outside the Romania box, when the striker was nearly in the clear. Free kick to Switzerland, yellow card to Grigore. Fourth Romania yellow.  6.32pm BST 74 min: Switzerland heap more pressure on Romania. Mehmedi lurks on the Swiss left, then clips a delicious ball high across the area. It goes over Embolo and finds Shaqiri unmarked. Unfortunately, it is behind him and he attempts an outrageous bicycle kick, with the ball ballooning off his shin and high over the goal. Oh. Updated at 6.39pm BST  6.30pm BST 73 min: Embolo is nearly clear again - though may have been offside - and Tatarusanu has to race out from his goalline to intercept the long through ball from Mehmedi. Embolo is certainly causing more problems than Seferovic. For a game I thought would be a purists delight, this has been pretty entertaining stuff. I wouldnt say its of stunning quality, but fun goes a long way, reckons Kri Tulinius, who is right.  6.28pm BST 71 min: Embolo tries to wiggle free in the Romania area but for all his power, his touch is a little agricultural. He knocks the ball so far past Chiriches it goes out for a goal kick.  6.27pm BST 69 min: Thats always good to see. Romania win a free kick that is virtually in their own half (I exaggerate). Torje sends all the big men into the box, then lashes the ball a full 5,000 yards at goal. Somner has to dive sharply to his left to save his dipping, thunderous drive. Theres something about an outrageously optimistic free-kick in a European Championship that is just a lot of fun to watch.  6.25pm BST 68 min: Lichsteiner swishes another good cross into the Romania area, taking two defenders out of the game. Embolo gets up to head it in, but catches the ball too fine and it goes out for a kick. Updated at 6.34pm BST  6.24pm BST 67 min: Dzemaili is in an acre of space in the Romania half. He pauses, then plays a lovely through ball to Embolo who breaks at speed. He cant do much with the pass though, so Switzerland head backwards and keep control in the Romania half. Theyre in control at the moment. You heard this here third:  @TomBry Embolo is the future! Went to school with him, amazing player. Will lead the Swiss to victory!  6.21pm BST 65 min: Hoban hoists a good ball into Keseru - or Kerazoo, as Andy Townsend is calling him on ITV - and he has a free header at goal, which he does not make the most of. Updated at 6.38pm BST  6.20pm BST 64 min: Seferovic is finally put out of his misery. Thats his second poor game in a row. Switzerland replace him with the 19-year-old Embolo, a fast, effective and physically imposing striker who probably should have started (hell score an own goal now).  6.18pm BST 60 min: Thats the end of Romanias Razvan Rat. Hes replaced by Filip, 13 years his junior and approximately 110 caps less experienced.  6.16pm BST 58 min: Shaqiri stands over a ball 10 yards outside the Romania box, having won the free-kick by being flattened while dribbling at pace at the area. He takes a few steps back then clobbers a left-foot shot at goal. Its a yard too high.   6.15pm BST 57 min: That was a netbuster from Mehmedi, a thunderous left-foot thrash into the opposite corner. Oof. Breel Embolo was about to come on for Switzerland, had taken his tracksuit off, done his warm-up and then that goal went in. Hes now sat back down.  6.13pm BST Mehmedi pulls a ball back across the Romania area to Seferovic, stationary on the penalty spot. The ball is tapped behind for a corner  and from it Mehmedi rams the ball home from 15 yards! Powerful strike. Updated at 6.20pm BST  6.10pm BST 53 min: Switzerland take their turn to attack as the game comes alive - Dzemaili thinks about rifling in a shot but instead crosses. Probably the wrong option and Romania can clear.  6.09pm BST 52 min: Torje toddles up the left wing, with Rodriguez in close attendance. Somehow Torje wangles a throw-in despite being the last man to touch the ball before it goes out. Romania spend the next minute or so flinging dangerous crosses into the area, with Switzerland worriedly clearing them. Finally Torje flings in the most dangerous of the lot and Djourou somehow slides in, two feet from the goal, and hoofs it wide when it looked for all the world like he was going to score an own goal. Updated at 6.17pm BST  6.07pm BST 50 min: Xhaka gets in a tangle with the ball and is robbed by Sapunaru. In his haste to get the ball back, Xhaka goes in on the Romanian man, who hits the deck. Xhaka is shown a yellow card, but replays suggested Sapunaru simply trod on the Swiss player and hit the deck. Updated at 6.16pm BST  6.06pm BST 48 min: But Switzerland arent letting Romania have it all their own way. Xhaka lurks outside the Romania box, looking for all the world like he is about to fire a long-range rasper at goal. Instead, he plays a diagonal ball to Shaqiri, who tears into the box but fires his shot into Chipcius leg. Corner. Which is wasted. Updated at 6.14pm BST  6.04pm BST 47 min: Romania have started brightly, and Torje attempts to race past the Swiss left back Rodriguez. Had he managed it, he would have had a simple pull back to Keseru. But he didnt.  6.03pm BST 46 min: Hoban immediately gets a chance. Stancu carves out an opening in the Swiss box, lays the ball off to the new man and he rasps an outside of the boot shot wide of SOmners goal. That was probably the best chance Romania have had all match in open play.  6.02pm BST Were off again: Romanias Hoban replaces Pintilii, who was injured at the end of the first half.  6.01pm BST David Mooney emails in about St Paulis spectacular move: I hope this trend catches on and when Arsenal sign their next twinkle-toed number 10, Arsene comes out for the unveiling in full Lordi regalia. Weird fact: I once interviewed Lordi in their full Lordi regalia. A little bit of behind the scenes knowledge for you: those costumes absolutely stink. Like proper, proper hum.  5.58pm BST Heres the latest from the Press Association on events in Lille:  Police in Lille have used tear gas on fans following scuffles in the city centre. Supporters were seen running through the streets before officers attempted to disperse them by firing the gas into the crowds. Fans from England, Wales, Slovakia and Russia have been gathering in the city for Group B matches between the countries.   5.56pm BST Kevin Porter emails: ITV commentator: Maybe if you are brought up in an neutral country, you lack aggression. Really, where do they recruit these people from, the past? Can the standard of commentary drop any lower? Stay tuned to this here commentary on the Guardian, Kevin, and you may well find out.  5.54pm BST Theres a lovely snippet from Jonathan Wilson about Romanian football in this Knowledge column from a few years back: scroll down to the 11th paragraph (begins But theres more. Jonathan Wilson points us towards etc etc) for a fabulous tale about how Chinese whispers and rampant corruption caused a side to beat another 9-0 thanks to some extravagant extra time.  Related: The Knowledge | Which teams have played for the wrong result? | John Ashdown   5.48pm BST Some half-time reading for you all, courtesy of Tom Davies  Related: Golden Goal: Ilie Dumitrescu for Romania v Argentina (1994) | Tom Davies   5.48pm BST Well, Romania have had no possession and seem intent on protecting their lead before mounting the odd counterattack via Chipciu. Switzerland need a new striker and they need Shaqiri to turn up as, increasingly, theyre getting panicky around the box.   5.47pm BST Schar concedes a corner, Romanias first of the afternoon. They take it short and then lift the ball to the far post before a Swiss head knocks it behind for Romanias second. That one is hoiked in and Seferovic heads it clear. With that, its half-time.  5.45pm BST 45 min: Stancu sells Djourou a dummy and goes past him. Somner, in the Swiss goal, thinks about coming and Stancus eyes light up but Schar is there to clear things up. Nearly a good breakaway move from Romania.  5.44pm BST 43 min: Romania have had almost no possession and could not care less about that. Switzerland pass the ball through them, carving another chance for Seferovic who heads the ball at goal but the Romania keeper claims.  5.42pm BST 41 min: Mehmedi breaks clear in the Romania area and rifles a shot from a tight angle. Chiriches dives in and blocks the ball before it gets further than six inches from Mehmedis boot. Switzerland do very little with the corner, and Romania break but, instead of waiting for more numbers, they blare a shot high and wide over Somners goal.  5.40pm BST 38 min: Pintilii has taken a knock and the Romanian physio applies some magic spray. When play restarts, Romania are lucky not to concede. Lichsteiner is played in up the right wing and clips a wonderful ball back across the area. Behrami is clear in the box and powers a header wide of the posts. Had that been on target - and it should have been, given the quality of the ball and the space Behrami had - it would have been 1-1. Poor from Switzerland. Updated at 5.52pm BST  5.37pm BST 36 min: Keseru pulls Behrami to the ground for no good reason: yellow card.  5.36pm BST 35 min: The dangerous Chipciu breaks clear down the Romania left again, leaving Schar for dust this time but playing a poor ball into the box. He sets up a Romania attack though, with the ball fizzing about the Swiss box, until eventually a ballooning ball lands in Somners hands. Switzerland dont like Romania running at them, as Corporal Jones might have said. Updated at 5.41pm BST  5.35pm BST 34 min: Corner to Switzerland, who are beginning to look a little tense. Rodriguez lifts an outswinger into the box but Xhaka cant get a big enough portion of his head onto the ball. Goal kick.  5.33pm BST 31 min: Dzemaili pokes a good ball through to Seferovic, but does so under heavy attention from Pintilii. The referee decides Pintiliis attentions are a little unfair and blows for a foul just outside the D. Rodriguez lines it up, firing the ball at Tatarusanus right hand post. The keeper was there to claim though. Meanwhile in Lille Police fire tear gas to clear area. pic.twitter.com/n3x4Ys43qm Updated at 5.38pm BST  5.30pm BST 28 min: In Lille, trouble is brewing between the England and Russia fans:  Latest from Lille https://t.co/1miu3wNnQr  5.29pm BST 27 min: Shaqiri has a nibble at Prepelita, conceding a free-kick on the left wing. The ball is launched into the box and the Swiss defence are all over the place. Sapunaru, on the penalty spot, has a chance and smashes a shot which clips the right hand upright and goes out.  5.26pm BST 25 min: Chipciu races clear up the Romanian left, leaving Lichsteiner for dust. He cuts inside, makes room for the shot and cant quite wrap enough of his foot around the ball to bend the ball past Somner. He looks dangerous. The Swiss fans know how to tailgate party:  Related: Euro 2016 picture of the day  Swiss start with a fondue   5.24pm BST 23 min: Oof 2: And thats another thumping challenge: Chipciu clatters Lichsteiner and earns himself yellow too. Shaqiri delivers a good ball into the near post but Seferovic - who is fast having a shocker - cant get a decent header on it. Meanwhile, Swiss anthem-gate rumbles on: @TomBry The Swiss recognise that their anthem is meh, and chose another one -- the process is still ongoing. Paul. https://t.co/9QObiyE43h  5.22pm BST 22 min: Oof: thats a challenge. Prepelita slides into the back of Xhaka who goes down in a crumpled heap. Yellow card for the Romania midfielder. Updated at 5.33pm BST  5.21pm BST 21 min: Switzerland are nearly level. Schar is a long way out but looks up and aims a howtizer at the Romania goal. Tatarusanu has to tip the ball over the bar as it dips and swerves towards the back of the net. Switzerland waste the corner.  5.20pm BST 19 min: The referee had no option but to award that: Chipciu was twisting, turning and wriggling his way through the Swiss defence. Lichsteiner had a fistful of his shirt and eventually the Romania midfielder simply had to hit the deck. Completely fair enough.  5.18pm BST A very cool low shot into the bottom left corner. His second penalty of the tournament. Updated at 5.24pm BST  5.18pm BST Chipciu fights his way into the Swiss box but is tugged down by Lichsteiner. Updated at 5.28pm BST  5.16pm BST 15 min: Shaqiri plays Seferovic in, the striker lurching into the box with the goal at his mercy. He draws back his foot, he takes aim, then he tickles the ball gently into the Romania keepers hands. How many chances does he need? Updated at 5.22pm BST  5.14pm BST 12 min: Its all Switzerland at the moment, and Lichsteiner finds himself with time and space to whip a cross in, shortly after Dzemaili had a chance to shoot but instead clipped the ball across the face of goal (to nobody). Switzerlands problem so far is that their buildup has been solid but theres been nobody in the box to hit with the ball.  5.12pm BST 10 min: Dzemaili wriggles free on the outskirts of the Romania box and whips a cross in, which is headed behind for a corner. Shaqiri hoofs the corner into the box and Tatarusanu punches clear.  5.10pm BST 9 min: Romania concede a pretty unnecessary foul, granting Switzerland a free-kick high up their left wing. Rodriguez hoists the ball into the box and all the Swiss big men launch themselves at the ball and - unfortunately for them - the Romanian players. Foul: goal kick. Updated at 5.12pm BST  5.09pm BST 8 min: Prepelita fizzes a cross into the Swiss box and Chipciu nods it on. Unfortunately, he nods it to Somner, who catches the ball with ease. @Tombry Did someone say charity begging bowl time? We're drawing all 800 Euro2016 Panini stickers to raise money :) pic.twitter.com/dI9tbQVxfq  5.07pm BST 7 min: Seferovic takes a pass on the edge of the Romania box, breaking free of Chiriches. He was wasteful against Albania, and this is another chance he sends begging - whistling the ball past the keepers left-hand post. Still, it was nice wriggling work to fashion the chance in the first place. Razvan Rat played a pivotal role in my hugely successful Macclesfield side in Football Manager, reports Ian Copestake. But that was back in the day before employers stopped allowing people to play it at work. So is Rat slow because he is very old or has the world changed since I lost that job? Because he is very old. Updated at 5.12pm BST  5.05pm BST 5 min: Lichsteiner takes the ball to the byline and whips a cross over to Seferovic and Mehmedi in the box. His cross is too high, however, and Romania clear. @TomBry You're right, the Swiss anthem is. But until 1961 it was even duller, to the same tune as God Save the Queen https://t.co/gukrlJRw6X  5.04pm BST 3 min: Seferovic flattens Prepelita in the centre circle, and looks guiltily at the ref. The ref doesnt give a flying one, however, so Switzerland attack, jagging the ball about between themselves outside the Romanian box. Eventually, things open up for Xhaka and he whistles a deflected shot at goal. Tatarusanu saves comfortably.  5.01pm BST 1 min: So much for Romania not attacking much. From the throw-in, they charge up the right via Torje, who crosses for Kerseru but Djourou just gets enough on the ball to deny the Romanian striker.  5.01pm BST Were off: Switzerland, in red shirts and white shorts kick off and attack from left to right. The ball immediately goes out for a throw-in to Romania, who are all in yellow. Updated at 5.08pm BST  4.59pm BST Afternoon Tom, chirps Simon McMahon. Is it still possible for Scotland to qualify for the round of 16 with no points? @TomBry Properly, I think we need to view this Group stage as ""last qualifying matches."" But my, they have been fun so far. More please!  4.57pm BST The Romanians are here now, fortunately. Anthem time: Switzerland go first: conservative, sombre, like a businesslike grey suit. Romania follow: stirring, brooding stuff. Sing along at home.  4.53pm BST Right, back to the game: the teams are in the tunnel - well, the Swiss are, the Romanians are still in the changing room. The Romanian mascots are lined up, however, perhaps theyll do?  4.51pm BST Charity begging bowl: the Guardians Michael Butler is going on a charity bike ride in aid of Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge: this minute-by-minute entry is the equivalent of somebody shaking a bucket at you. Dig deep, dig often.  4.48pm BST Re. Olivers poser as 16.28, heres Gordon Smith: You can qualify with one point. If the points in a group end 9,6,1,1 and at least three groups end this way then at least one of them will qualify for the last 16.  What a format!  4.40pm BST Just in case you havent seen it, this - by quite some distance - is the football story of the day:   Related: St Pauli manager misses unveiling of new signing, so club use man in mask   4.34pm BST Well, if Rat doesnt have the legs to chase Shaqiri around all day, at least the Romanians have a spare Lung on the bench, honks Justin Kavanagh. Honk!  4.32pm BST In answer to Oliver, below, then yes: if every team in a group won one, lost one and drew one each side would finish with four points. The group would be settled on goal difference - so one side would go out as the fourth placed side with four points. Its entirely conceivable that a side in another group could finish with three points and go through. I think, but Im simple folk.  4.28pm BST One for the hive mind: Ive just been looking at my wallchart at work trying to figure something out, emails Oliver, who works in the sort of place where theyre allowed to look at wallcharts while at work. Is it at all possible that a team in fourth place in one group could have a better record than a team in third place in another, but that third place team make it through to the last 16?  4.25pm BST Catch up on what happened at the Stade Pierre Mauroy, with Jamie Jacksons report: Russia 1-2 Slovakia (spoiler alert)  Related: Marek Hamsiks sumptuous strike gives Slovakia the edge over Russia   4.18pm BST In the buildup to the match - its worth giving our interactive guide to the teams and players another look:   Related: Euro 2016: the complete guide to every squad and every player in France   4.08pm BST Romania have stuck by Razvan Rat, whose lack of pace was put to the test by France. Hell be up against Shaqiri this afternoon, which ought mean another tricky day at the office for him. Filip, who might have replaced Rat, remains on the bench.  4.06pm BST Romania: Tatarusanu, Sapunaru, Chiriches, Grigore, Rat, Prepelita, Pintilii, Torje, Stancu, Chipciu, Keseru.  Subs: Pantilimon, Matel, Moti, Hoban, Alibec, Stanciu, Andone, Gaman, Filip, Sanmartean, Popa, Lung.  Switzerland: Sommer, Lichtsteiner, Schar, Djourou, Rodriguez, Behrami, Xhaka, Shaqiri, Dzemaili, Mehmedi, Seferovic.  Subs: Hitz, Moubandje, Elvedi, von Bergen, Lang, Embolo, Frei, Zakaria, Fernandes, Tarashaj, Derdiyok, Burki.  Referee: Sergei Karasev (Russia)  Updated at 4.32pm BST  12.24pm BST On the surface, this does not have thrills and spills written all over it. Romania - doughty against France in the opening match of the tournament - conceded just two goals in the qualifiers but in their last five competitive fixtures have scored just five goals (three of them against Faroe Islands, one of them from the penalty spot against France). Switzerland, for their part, made a very good start against Albania, scoring inside the first five minutes, then struggled to keep it up for the rest of the match. So, what weve got here is: team who defend well but dont score very much v team that struggled to score against minnows. That said, Switzerland should score. Just look at the talent available to them. Granit Xhaka is a maestro, Xherdan Shaqiri has scored four and made five goals in his last eight competitive matches. At some point, surely the team have to live up their perennial tag of dark horses and go on a run. Victory here would mean they would be the first team to go into the knockout stages.  There are a few ructions in their squad at the moment though: Shaqiri has threatened to ditch Switzerland for the newly Uefa-recognised Kosovo, particularly if the side offer him the captaincy that Switzerland have not. Hes been doing his bit for team morale by talking about that in the buildup to this match which is good of him. Romania will be set up to frustrate and perhaps rightly so. A draw here, then victory over Albania could well see them safely into the knockout stages as one of the best third-placed teams. Their coach, Anghel Iordanescu has just about said as much too: We have to be realistic; we have to understand that well be playing against a very good side. Their 23 players play in big leagues like the Bundesliga. Our objective is to qualify from the group. Romania took confidence from their performance against France, despite their disappointment at conceding a late Dimitri Payet winner, and they will be determined not to lose this one too.  There is some historic needle to the match too. These two teams met in their second match at the 1994 World Cup finals when, under Roy Hodgson, the Swiss beat Romania 4-1 in Detroit. Romania recovered to win the group and went through to the quarter finals (courtesy of the delicious Hagi), though, and Switzerland went home in the round of 16. Three years earlier, Romania beat Switzerland in qualifying for Euro 92, meaning they failed to qualify for the tournament and Scotland got in. So thats some 22 year old needle right there.

Stanciue finds space outside the box, smashes a shot over, and this is basically done!  9.52pm BST 90+3 min Torja shoves Lila to the ground, and is booked. The ref somehow avoids awarding a free-kick, but it makes no odds - Albania clear when the ball comes in, AND THEYRE NEARLY THERE!  9.51pm BST 90+2 min France and Switzerland have drawn 0-0. Memushaj, who has been superb, flicks a ball around the corner, putting Roshi in, but draws the foul at the same time. More time elapses, and the ball goes towards Cana at the far post - he hads into the keepers arms.  Updated at 9.52pm BST  9.49pm BST 90+1 min Memushaj and Roshi do very well to win a corner down the left, then equally well to spend 30 seconds not taking it.   9.49pm BST 90 min One of the Albanians is down, clutching his head and face, so theres a short break while he pretends to recover. Therell be a minimum additional five minutes of play.   9.48pm BST 89 min But Andone throws himself at a short ball, knocking Mavraj out of the road - only for Ajeti, who has been superb, to block tackle a clearance. Thats an actual block tackle, not one of these.  9.46pm BST 88 min Lyon is about to witness the mother, father, any other of all parties.  Updated at 9.55pm BST  9.46pm BST 87 min Monstrous effort from Albania to win another corner, this time from right, and from it comes another free header - Hysaj guides it wide from 10 yards.   9.45pm BST  9.45pm BST 86 min Albania break, and Roshis fresh legs pace downfield, winning a corner - he exhorts the fans to even greater efforts, then Mavraj wins the header at the near post, ruffling the side-netting and causing some to celebrate the clinching goal.   9.43pm BST 84 min Again, Torje breaks with conviction, attacking the Albanian box - so Ajeti kncks him over from behind. Free-kick, 30 yards out, just left of centre, and Memushaj is booked for encroachment before Torjes kick hits the wall.  Updated at 10.14pm BST  9.41pm BST 83 min Albania make their final change, Cana on for Basha.   9.40pm BST 81 min Stanciu weaves past Basha 40 yards out and accelerates towards goal, but as he shoots his left foot gives way and the ball flies miles over the top. The Albanian fans are absolutely having it.   9.37pm BST 79 min Albania are sitting in now, and Romanias changes have made a differenc, or, put another way, Iordanescu got his team wrong. No, you tell him.   9.36pm BST 78 min Change for Albania: Roshi replaces Lenjani.   9.35pm BST 76 min Thats more like it from Romania, a lively touch from Torje finding Sanmartean, who flicks himself, finding Andone. From just inside the box, he absolutely rousts a drive that clips the bar and shoots over the top. Great move, great effort.  Updated at 9.39pm BST  9.33pm BST 75 min France-Switzerland is still 0-0 and Payet has just hit the bar - but they dont need to start playing for another 14 minutes.   9.33pm BST 74 min Albania gives it away just outside their box and Romania fly forwards, but Ajeti does superbly to marshall Stanciu away from goal before diving in and rescuing possession.  Updated at 9.46pm BST  9.31pm BST 72 min Romania break the Albanian line down the right, and just as Torje crosses, up goes the flag. and up goes Balajs thumb, thanking the linesman for his benevolence - for that was on, and he knew it.   9.29pm BST 71 min Albania win a throw on the right, hurled at Balaj to chest down for Memushaj to shoot. He doesnt trouble Tatarusanu, but really, Romania had no business allowing that to develop.   9.28pm BST 70 min Romania have 20 minutes to save themselves. They really do not look like so doing.   9.27pm BST 68 min Final change for Romania: Andone replaces Big Popa.   9.26pm BST 66 min Lovely from Sanmartean, who rides one tackle then another, taking care to hurtle over it and win a free-kick, 30 yards out, left of centre. He takes it himself, looking to go round the far side of the wall, instead hitting his team-mate. Not that it made much difference - it was not going to trouble Berisha.   9.23pm BST 65 min Sanmartean fouls Lenjani for no reason, and Albania have another free-kick close to the corner flag, this time on the left. But by the time it comes over, the refs spotted a foul, and Romania start again.   9.22pm BST 63 min Albania havent shown much in attack this last bit, but then the outstanding Memushaj wriggles between two spaces just outside the right corner of the box, swinging though a snap=shot that forces Berisha to beat away.   9.20pm BST 61 min Some conviction from Romania, Sanmartean finding Torje who spreads wide to the right. Sapunaru then crosses, winning a corner which comes to nothing.   9.19pm BST 60 min When did attacking players become known as progressive? The first usage I can recall is Alex Ferguson talking about Kleberson. Surely that shouldve been an end to it?   9.18pm BST 59 min Lila jumps and Matel nails him with the little leg nudge that sends him toppling. No one seems to mind too much, though it looks a right sair yin.   9.17pm BST 59 min Change for Albania: the goalscorer Sadiku departs; Balaj replaces him.  Updated at 9.17pm BST  9.16pm BST 58 min Joy well never know. Sadiku's sixth goal for #ALB - and surely his most memorable.#EURO2016 #ROUALB pic.twitter.com/02vR5SRIqE  9.15pm BST 57 min Torje replaces Alibec, who departs on a stretcher, gesticulating.   9.14pm BST 55 min Alibec and Basha chases a loose ball and both leap, Alibec landing on his left foot which gives way in ominous fashion. He looks in absolutely oodles of pain, while being desperate to get in with the game.  Updated at 9.28pm BST  9.13pm BST 54 min But Memushajs crosses is overhit, missing the men clustered at the back post.   9.12pm BST 53 min Albania are running like billy-o here, and Abrashi chases Matel right into the corner, tempting him to give away a free-kick close to the flag. Its getting busy in the box.   9.10pm BST 52 min Dion Dublin said at half-time that trust is the biggest word in football, emails the aptly-named David English. I think there are bigger words, like offside, referee, defence, and Ledian Memushaj. Im not going to make the obvious gag here. Youre welcome.  Updated at 9.10pm BST  9.09pm BST 50 min Romania have shown a little more gumption these last few minutes, but then they started the first half reasonably too, and theres Memushaj, intercepting a stray pass and charging into the Romania half - its two-on-two! But the defenders are well positioned, so that when he squares to Sadiku, who is not well furnished with pace, he has to come back insdie and the chance goes.   9.07pm BST 49 min There shall be an extra two minutes? You have been listening to too much LVG! chides Tony Waters.  Me and him, bringing sexy back.   9.06pm BST 49 min Meanwhile, JR from Illinois emails: Remember that time about 25 minutes ago when Lenjani had that astounding miss? Well I hope this information wont ruin it for you but our announcer here in the U.S. has stated that the flag did belatedly go up ruling Lenjani offside. Hes making it up.   9.05pm BST 48 min That half-time change - it was indeed Prepelita who was hooked, with Sanmartean replacing him.   9.05pm BST 46 min Immediately, Albania win a corner down the right, clipped to the near post where Mavraj power-glances just over the top.   9.04pm BST 46 min And off we go. Romania have made one change - I think Prepelita has gone off.   9.03pm BST The players are back with us. The Romanians are still alive.   9.02pm BST So, what do Albania need to qualify? Well, if neither Ireland nor Sweden get three points - of which theres a good chance - if Germany wallop Northern Ireland, or Turkey and the Czech Republic draw, that should do it.   8.52pm BST Half-time entertainment:  8.51pm BST How much did Sadiku enjoy the #ALB goal? This much...#EURO2016 pic.twitter.com/HUCY7wQf4T  8.51pm BST Tirana tonight pic.twitter.com/TXkTdUHCOL  8.49pm BST Again, Albania have been excellent. Romania have been abject.   8.48pm BST 46+2 min Maybe if Tatarusanu tells Iordanescu to look one way, then runs the other, he might escape the hiding thats in the post.   8.47pm BST 45 min There shall be two additional minutes.   8.46pm BST 44 min This is really superbly done by Albania, Lila crossing towards the back post where Sadiku pulls of Chiriches, who follows him. And, for no reason whatsoever, Tataratsanu does too, meaning that any connection - and there follows a good one, Sadiku hanging in the air, leaning away from goal - will leave him stranded. Albania go absolutely wild, and theyve every right to go wild.  Updated at 10.16pm BST  8.44pm BST ALBANIA HAVE THEIR FIRST GOAL AT A MAJOR TOURNAMENT! AND DONT THEY DESERVE IT!  Updated at 10.17pm BST  8.43pm BST 41 min This has been lamentable from Romania, and again they cede possession in midfield, where Memushaj, whos playing well, cant control Agollis ball as it drops. It wasnt an easy skill - killing a ball at shin-height and transferring it into stride at the same time - but had he managed it, he was away.   8.40pm BST 39 min Dont believe me? Simply inspect his sideboards, here.   8.40pm BST 37 min Romania are going to absolutely get it at half-time. Anghel Iordanescu is not a man with whom it pays to trifle.   8.37pm BST 35 min Super stuff from Albania, Memushaj taking a quick throw from Agolli and nashing into the box from the right, absolutely murdering Prepelita on the outside with a delicious turn. then, he might look across goal where two men wait - admittedly shepherded by two defenders - but instead forces a shot towards the near post, where Tatrusanu saves.  Updated at 8.41pm BST  8.34pm BST 33 min A choice Romanian cut.  8.33pm BST 31 min Sadiku pulls off left and his trickery earns Albania a throw in, deep in the Romania half. Agolli chucks it straight to Sapunaru, and Romania clear.   8.30pm BST 29 min Despite the miss - did I mention, Albania missed an incredible opportunity? - they are on top at the moment. Romania cant hold onto possession at all.   8.29pm BST 28 min I was at the 1989 game in your clip, emails Justin Horton. What I mostly remember is that due to the bar at the top of the fencing, I had the choice between watching disembodied heads above it, or disembodied legs chasing the ball below it. Happy days, not. Yes, that was the first England game after Hillsbrough, if memory serves. What a total mess the old Wembley is; what a shame they couldnt do a better job of building the new one.   8.28pm BST 26 min Lila chases a long ball which is fielded by Tatarusanu, whom he petulantly shoves. Immediately, history is replayed and Lenjani slots his cross home, putting Albania in front.  Updated at 8.28pm BST  8.26pm BST 25 min What a miss that was!   8.26pm BST 23 min What a magnificent, spectacular, outstanding, classic miss! Albania sweep forwards, Agolli finding Memushaj with a lovely ball. He has options left and right and picks the latter, finding Lila, whose cross is perfect, picking out Lenjani at the back post. The keeper is more or less down, but from five yards he elects to slide, wellying his effort well over the bar. Some unkind folk might consider that karmic retribution for a right-winder wearing number 3 - and a left-winger, Lila, wearing 2.  Updated at 8.48pm BST  8.24pm BST 22 min Hysaj rattles through Sapunaru, winning the ball then cleaning him out with his trailing leg. To his chagrin, there follows a free-kick wide on the right, which Stanciu wastes.   8.23pm BST 21 min I really dont grasp why Romania feel they need two holding midfielders for this game. Similarly, I had no idea why Deschamps felt that he needed the same against Albania last week. Sure, they make it physical, but the key is to outpass them, not outfight them.   8.21pm BST 20 min Basha strides through midfield and has options both left and right, so drags a useless shot straight at Tatarusanu.  Updated at 8.28pm BST  8.20pm BST 19 min Given how badly they need to win, Romania are not playing with a great deal of intensity or abandon.  Updated at 8.20pm BST  8.19pm BST 18 min Elsewhere in Group A, Paul Pogba has nearly scored thrice, hitting the bar twice.  Updated at 8.19pm BST  8.18pm BST 15 min Not much going on so far - thus a goal from my childhood scored against Albania by the immaculate Peter Beardsley.  8.15pm BST 13 min Cant believe youve not mentioned Norman Wisdom, tweets Manc in Sofia. Wisdoms were the only films allowed to be shown in Albania during the dictatorship of Enver Hoxha, so here we go.  8.13pm BST 12 min Romania conceded just two goals in qualifying - but then, Albania ought to have scored against France, and what a defence they have.   8.11pm BST 10 min Id go with Eurovision-style voting, says the mild mannered Marie Meyer. Talking of which, this is probably my favourite ever winning song. TUNE!  8.10pm BST 8 min Romania turn it up when play restarts, and Hysaj heads away weakly, his clearance falling onto the laces of Sadiku, who swivels to volley hard - Berisha punches clear well.   8.08pm BST 6 min Basha announces his presence, flying through the air to absolutely De Jong Hoban. He gets a yellow card when really that might have been a red - has Graham Poll returned from retirement?  Updated at 8.22pm BST  8.06pm BST 5 min Romania attack down the left, and Hoban slides forward to try a curler into the far bottom corner. Berisha is paying attention, but only just - he shovels a parry thats not far from Stanciu, following up, before diving on the loose ball.  Updated at 8.19pm BST  8.04pm BST 3 min First shot on goal of the night - Alibec lays back to Stanciu, and from 25 yards he slams with his laces just over the top.   8.04pm BST 3 min The Romanian fans are absolutely going for it. That said, Im not sold on the merits of yellow as a colour for a football kit - its a bit insipid, in mine. And no, Id not tell that to the sun.   8.02pm BST 1 min The ball does some bouncing around in centrefield. Good for it.   8.01pm BST 1 min Romania get us underway.   8.01pm BST Im not going to lie, we are not in for a goalfest. But then we havent had that all tournament, and weve seen hardly any boring games, so.   7.57pm BST Loving the extra matches, tweets Paul, though 3rd place qual. criteria needs work. Why are they playing two at the same time on a Sunday? To prevent collusion in the final round of games.   7.56pm BST Time for the anthems. Might a game be about to start on time?   7.51pm BST When I were a lad, eee, me and me mates used to play a game called Not Kosher. The rules were: everyone gets on the bed, which is Kosher. Last one left on the bed wins, everyone removed therefrom is not Kosher.  To be clear, this predates the Royal Rumble.   7.50pm BST How else might you split teams in the event of a tie? How about breath-holding? Or slapsies?   7.49pm BST More permutation news: If Switzerland lose 2-1, and Romania win 1-0, the second place is down to the fair play rule, means number of bookings Makes perfect sense.   7.47pm BST Someones put Seven Nation army on the PA. What a ruse! Inspired!  7.47pm BST Also for your delectation:   Related: Switzerland v France: Euro 2016  live!   7.41pm BST Taking of those Albanian fans, theyre already at it tonight, in and bouncing. Which makes one wonder whether English fans are too preoccupied with the admittedly preoccupying preoccupations of slaking thirst and looking cool. Because theyd still be in the pub wearing different clothes and all that.   7.38pm BST So, lets hear your thoughts: did Uefa get it right - presumably for the wrong reasons - in expanding the competition and giving us loads more lovely football? Or is it ridiculous playing 36 games to eliminate only eight teams?   7.36pm BST One team remain unchanged: the Albanian supporters, an undoubted star of the group stages.   7.34pm BST So, one change for Albania: Basha replaces the suspended Kekeli. Romania, meanwhile, replace Rat with Matel, Pintilli with Hoban, Chipciu with Popa and Keseru with Alibec.   7.28pm BST Albania (4-3-3): Berisha; Hysaj, Ajeti, Mavraj, Agolli; Basha, Abrashi, Memushaj; Lenjani, Sadiku, Lila. Romania (4-2-3-1): Tatarusanu; Sapunaru, Grigore, Chiriches, Matel; Prepelita, Hoban; Popa, Stanciu, Stancu; Alibec. Updated at 7.31pm BST  6.48pm BST Slow, slow, quick; after two rounds of games, here begins the crucial third round; over the next four nights, we shall discover which teams progress to the knockout stages. Almost all of them! I hear you holler and yes, that is so. But its also so that no team is yet eliminated, which is going to make for one hell of a bagarre. Starting right here.  So, any win for Romania will probably be enough - and if France beat Switzerland, they might qualify in second place. Albania, meanwhile, are also not out of things, but need a thumping win followed by incompetence elsewhere.  Its time to see whos got what. Kick-off: 8pm BST  10.41am BST Daniel will be here soon enough. Until then, read how the Albania coach, Gianni De Biasi, is keeping himself upbeat by dangling a carrot full of incentives in front of his squad:   It may have been a wilful attempt to keep expectations at rock bottom but pre-tournament discussion in Albania centred for the most part on the nations happiness to have reached their first tournament. A dream, said the manager, Gianni De Biasi, on the eve of their opening game, intimating that the real achievement was just getting to France. Now they are two games in, the feeling must be some way different. Before an eminently winnable group closer against Romania a sense of what might have been has crept in. The Switzerland match, where they fell behind early on but created numerous chances, slipped away on account of the captain Lorik Canas entirely avoidable sending off in the first half. Against France they defended brilliantly for 89 minutes before breaking at the death, conceding twice for a largely undeserved 2-0 defeat.

There have been the inevitable and understandable questions about the impact on team harmony.</p> <p>Shaqiri is not backward in coming forwards.

Shaqiri was born in 1991 in Kosovo. His family emigrated to Switzerland when he was a baby and he declared for the country in which he was raised. The Stoke City player was given his senior international debut in 2010 by Ottmar Hitzfeld, the manager at the time, and he was a surprise inclusion in his squad for that years World Cup. He has since played at the 2014 World Cup. He is one of the glamour names in Vladimir Petkovics squad. The possibility exists, however, that Shaqiri could be allowed to switch his allegiance, despite having played competitive matches for Switzerland, because Kosovo is a new nation. The suggestion he was open to the possibility has coloured the news agenda before the Romania game. Petkovic has other players in his squad who were born in Kosovo or have Kosovo-Albanian heritage and, as such, would be eligible to switch  the midfielders Granit Xhaka, Valon Behrami, Admir Mehmedi and Blerim Dzemaili and the forward Shani Tarashaj. All of them bar Tarashaj, a 21-year-old prospect who has signed for Everton, started against Albania. There is nervousness in Albania, too, that some of their players who are eligible to switch to Kosovo might choose to do so while some in the same situation with other countries, including Belgiums Adnan Januzaj  the Manchester United winger  have indicated that they will think about it. Xhaka and Behrami, Petkovics central midfield pair, said before the start of the championship that they would remain true to Switzerland, and the issue was supposed to have been parked until after the finals. Shaqiri has brought it back to the fore. His timing has been criticised in Switzerland. Why now, as the team prepare for a crucial game? There have been the inevitable and understandable questions about the impact on team harmony. Shaqiri is not backward in coming forwards. He is a player who craves the spotlight, who wants to be the top dog, and there are those in Switzerland who have interpreted his comment about Kosovo as a bit of self-promotion, an attempt to offer a reminder of his worth. Shaqiris line about the captaincy could also be significant. When Petkovic took the difficult decision to drop the long-time captain, Gokhan Inler, after the midfielder had endured a frustrating season at Leicester City, he gave the armband to Stephan Lichtsteiner, the Juventus full-back, and named Xhaka and Behrami as vice-captains. Shaqiri was not happy and he said so. How could he have been excluded from the inner circle? It is other Switzerland players who are currently in the spotlight, particularly Xhaka, who has completed a move to Arsenal from Borussia Mnchengladbach for around 30m and Breel Embolo, the 19-year-old forward who is expected to leave Basel this summer for the highest fee ever paid to a Swiss club. It has been reported that Manchester United have had talks with his agent  who is Shaqiris brother, Erdin  while other clubs in England and Germany have been credited with an interest. Embolo can play anywhere in the attacking line and there has been a clamour for him to start against Romania, most likely in place of Mehmedi. Embolo came on for him in the 62nd minute against Albania. Lichtsteiner has been feted and then there is Yann Sommer, the goalkeeper. He made some vital interventions against Albania, including a decisive, late, one-on-one block from a substitute, Shkelzen Gashi. Shaqiri is determined to regain centre stage. Switzerland (probable): Sommer; Lichsteiner, Schar, Djourou, Rodriguez; Behrami, Dzemaili, Xhaka; Shaqiri, Seferovic, Mehmedi. Romania (probable): Tatarusanu; Sapunaru, Grigore, Chiriches, Rat; Hoban, Pintilii; Stanciu, Popa, Stancu; Andone. Referee S Karasev (Rus)"

Romania were crushed and, when Payet was substituted in injury-time and the stadium rose to acclaim him, the tears welled in his eyes. He tried to hold them back but he could not. When they trickled down his face, it was the standout image of a helter-skelter evening in which France had been charged with offering a tonic to a nation that surely needed one. The buildup had been testing, with the national state of emergency lending an understandable edginess. Elsewhere for France there have been the strikes and the floods, the race rows and the scandals. The football was supposed to bring succour. It did so in the end, but only after a performance that was undercut by anxiety and which did little to embellish Frances status as the tournament favourites. They were indebted to Hugo Lloris for a close-range block from Bogdan Stancu in the early running and also for a gilt-edged miss by the Romania midfielder at the beginning of the second half. The result could have gone the other way.  Related: Frances match-winner Dimitri Payet overcome by emotion of late drama  Olivier Giroud had one of those games with which Arsenal supporters have become familiar over the second half of the season. Three times he missed chances  the first was clear-cut  but he was able to give France the lead after an error from the Romania goalkeeper Ciprian Tatarusanu, who came for a Payet cross only to miss it. Tatarusanu felt he had been impeded by Giroud and the Romania manager, Anghel Iordanescu, said he could not and did not want to answer questions about the incident. Romania were never out of contention and they drew level when France failed to clear Adrian Popas cross from the right. The excellent Nicolae Stanciu surged towards goal and he was blocked by a reckless challenge from Patrice Evra. The stadium howled when the penalty was bravely and correctly awarded by the Hungarian referee, Viktor Kassai, and Stancu rolled it past Lloris. Payet, though, would fashion the sting in the tale. After the pomp of the opening ceremony, which had featured can-can dancers, a levitating Eiffel Tower and David Guetta  among many other things  France struggled to come to terms with the occasion. Didier Deschamps, the manager, referenced how his players had begun in timid fashion. The hosts spurned two glorious chances to get the early goal they craved. Payet crossed only for the unmarked Giroud to head wastefully wide and Antoine Griezmann hit the post at the second attempt after initially missing his kick from Bacary Sagnas cross. The ball rebounded to him off Vlad Chiriches. Romania ought to have been in front with their first meaningful chance, and what a chance it was. Stancius corner was flicked on and Stancu looked certain to score at the far post from three yards out. His shot, though, was too close to Lloris, who saved instinctively. It was a pivotal moment. From the resulting corner Florin Andone looped a header on to the roof of the net.  Related: Olivier Giroud divides opinion but was pivotal as France conquered Romania  Deschamps accepted his teams performance was far from perfect and it was curious to see how peripheral Paul Pogba was. Griezmann also laboured and both of them were substituted. Griezmann dragged his heels as he departed. Evra had a poor game and there were times when France looked shaky at the back. Griezmann went close towards the end of a subdued first half and Giroud, having outmuscled Chiriches on a corner, headed high but Romania could lament Stancus miss in the 47th minute. Stancius cross was perfect and so was the timing of Stancus run and first touch. The side-on volley was set up but he shinned it wide. France sought to turn the screw. Giroud worked Tatarusanu when he might have done better and Pogba  Frances poster boy for the championship  extended the Romania goalkeeper more fully with a vicious volley from Payets cross. The breakthrough came when Tatarusanu flapped at another Payet delivery. Perhaps he had been unnerved by the manner in which Giroud jumped; the striker appeared to lead with his elbow. There was no serious contact, though, and Giroud was able to guide a header into the empty net. Game over? Not at all. Only Evra knew what he was thinking about when he hung out a leg at Stanciu and Stancu sensed redemption with his penalty conversion. The last word, however, went to Payet."

The move on Tuesday reverses a trend which has seen the number of large carnivores being shot by hunters grow year on year since Romanias accession into the European Union in 2007. In 2016, the largest hunting quotas yet gave hunters the mandate to shoot 550 bears, 600 wolves and 500 big cats over 12 months.  Over the last decade, hunting has grown into a multimillion-euro industry in Romania, with hunters from all over the world paying up to 10,000 (8,800) to claim a trophy hunting parlance for the carcass of a hunted animal  from the Carpathian mountains.  The government has claimed that in order to exist, the industry relies on a loophole in European law which allows for the culling of wild animals that have been proven to be a danger to humans. Under the habitats directive, all large carnivores are protected in European Union member states, yet the state can order the killing of specific animals if shown to have attacked a person or damaged private property. Hunting for money was already illegal, but it was given a green light anyway, environment minster, Cristiana Pasca-Palmer, told the Guardian. The damages [clause in the habitats directive] acted as a cover for trophy hunting. Each year, hundreds of hunting associations across the country would submit two numbers; the total population of each large carnivore species, and the total number which they believed to be likely to cause damages. The second number would then act as a basis for a government-issued hunting quota for each species. These quotas were then carved up between hunting companies and sold as hunting rights to the public.  This method raised some questions, says Pasca-Palmer. How can hunting associations count how many animals are causing damages a priori  before the damages have happened? By introducing the ban, what we are doing is simply putting things back on the right track, as the habitats directive originally intended. Wildlife NGOs claim that the methodology also tended to dramatically overestimate the populations of large carnivores. The official figure for the number of bears in Romania is over 6,000, and for wolves is 4,000. Yet with hundreds of hunting associations each responsible for monitoring a small area of land, and animals prone to wandering, it is understood that individual animals were often counted multiple times, potentially pushing the total population statistics up by thousands.  Related: Romanian politician calls for the army to help control bear population  Announced late on Tuesday evening, the ban is expected to divide Romanias population, pitching rural and urban dwellers against each other. The governments decision has strong support in the larger cities, which have seen a growing movement against hunting in recent months. But in much of Romanias remote countryside large carnivores are a daily threat to villagers and a persistent nuisance to livestock farmers, and many see hunting as the only solution. Csaba Domokos, a bear specialist with wildlife protection NGO Milvus group, is convinced that the success or failure of the hunting ban rides on the governments ability to address the rural populations fears.  Damages caused by large carnivores are a very real concern in the countryside, he said. The system up until now did not work; hunting does not reduce conflicts between carnivores and humans; in fact many studies show that with wolves and large cats, it can actually increase the problem.  But the rural population believe that hunting is the answer, and unless they can be convinced otherwise, people may well start to take the problem into their own hands. The ban is a great step, but we dont want hunting to be replaced by poaching. Domokos points out that hunters also have a vested interested in the protection of their quarry. To some extent, hunting acts as a financial incentive for wildlife management, from preventing poaching to conserving habitats. There is some concern that once you take that away, the government will not invest enough to replace it. The governments response is to take management into its own hands. A special unit is to be set up within the paramilitary police force that will assess any reports of damages by large carnivores and deal with the culprit animal directly. The ministry of environment have discussed the possibility of relocating the target animals abroad to countries interested in rewilding.  The ban comes amid a growing push for the protection of Romanias wild mountains that has seen anti-corruption officers convict dozens of foresters, hunters and local officials in recent years.  Gabriel Paun, an activist and conservationist behind a petition that collected 11,000 signatures in the weeks before the hunting ban, sees the governments decision as a step towards a safer future for Europes wild spaces: The Carpathian mountains are home to more biodiversity than anywhere else in Europe, but for too long they have been ruthlessly exploited for forestry and hunting. Lets hope the governments decision is a sign of things to come."

Her clothes are clean and her was hair neatly combed that morning. This is not how she arrived at the centre. Washed away is the froth of paint and glue from her lips and chin. Alina sleeps in a railway station. She finds hiding places in the shadows, away from predators, abusers and the winter rain. An estimated 1,000 children live on the citys streets  although social workers tell me the actual figure could be double that. The children shelter in public buildings or in the maze of tunnels buried beneath Romanias capital city. A social worker at the day centre explains that most of the children have run away from orphanages, though some were born on the streets. This was the case with Alina. Her mother initially accepted state care, but when Alina turned two, her mother had to leave her alone in an orphanage or risk living together on the streets. She chose the latter and, shortly afterwards, died from substance abuse. At the day centre Alina has a volunteer helping her learn to read. She is also learning to become a clown. Street juggling and performance is a safe and legitimate way for her to make money. Clowns are magicians, the social worker adds. They can make all sorts of things happen  and when the children put on the costume they no longer see themselves as dirty sub-humans. It allows their brain to see themselves in a new positive way. This is critical in a culture where it is normal for homeless children to inhale from plastic bags filled with industrial paint.  Related: Ceausescus children | Wendell Steavenson  The street children are a legacy from the days of the Ceauescu dictatorship. In the 1960s a decree banning abortion, contraception and promoting large families resulted in a baby boom. Abandonment and neglect became normal practice and abuse of these children in orphanages commonplace. Often they ran away from the orphanages, preferring the uncertainty of street life. These children had their own children and now, three or four generations later, they live short, vulnerable, painful lives on the streets. Social work was also outlawed under Ceauescu and the profession had to start again after his execution in 1989. There was a lot to catch up on. For the past 25 years, successive governments have tried, unsuccessfully, to curb poverty but financial support alone, such as cash transfers, has not worked. By 2014, 52.2% of children in Romania are at risk of poverty or social exclusion (pdf), while more than 40% of the population live under the poverty line. Without social workers and their skills, a country cannot progress in terms of social inclusion According to Ana Radulescu, general manager of ASproAS, a professional social worker association: Providing financial support is only one part of the solution. This strategy by itself will not shift the causes of poverty.  Recognising that past attempts to alleviate poverty have failed, the new minister of labour and social protection, Dragos Pislaru, understands that social work is fundamental to enable people to sustainably escape cycles of poverty. Romania can only move forward when we understand that inclusion is not achieved just by giving money away, Pislaru says. A society cannot progress economically when an important part of the country lives in social exclusion. Without social workers and their skills, a country cannot progress in terms of social inclusion. Under this government, Radulescu says: Social workers are being recognised for competencies that help people not only access resources, but also use those resources in changing their lives. Pislaru, Radulescu and social workers are working together to promote integration across government departments. Their joint vision is to ensure that social workers are active in every community social service by bringing together experienced social workers to empower individuals and communities to regain control, confidence and security in their own lives.

The EBU, which runs Eurovision, said Romanias national broadcaster, Televiziunea Romana, had failed to pay debts totalling more than 7.9m. Ingrid Deltenre, director general of the EBU, said it was regrettable that we are forced to take this action but four attempts to get a response from the Romanian government had received no reply.  The continued indebtedness of TVR jeopardises the financial stability of the EBU itself, Deltenre said, confirming that the Romanian act, Ovidiu Anton, would be taken out of the running order of the second semi-final on 12 May.  When the expulsion was first rumoured, TVR insisted it had paid off debts for the period 2008 to 2012, but added: The latest payment was made in January this year in the amount of 250,000 after which TVR informed the international organisation that it cant sustain these payments any more. On Monday, Romanias prime minister, Dacian Ciolos, said the government would seek a solution to avoid being locked out of the competition. A deadline for payment was extended until Thursday, but no payment was received, according to EBU.  In recent weeks, the ministry of finance has suggested TVR, which recorded losses of more than 4.2m last year, may face insolvency proceedings and a dramatic restructuring.  This is of course disappointing for the artist chosen to represent Romania, for our colleagues at TVR who have prepared their participation so well this year and, not least, for Romanian viewers and the many Eurovision fans in the country, says Jon Ola Sand, executive supervisor of the Eurovision song contest at the EBU. Anton, who was set to perform his English-language song Moment of Silence, said he had also been kept in the dark. I dont think this should happen to any artist, he told the Guardian last week.  No one has contacted me. Ive just heard the rumours and seen the news. Im just going to pretend I didnt hear anything and keep preparing until I am told otherwise. Hopefully it will be solved. Romania has never finished higher than third in the competition in 22 years of participating. The contest will be held in Sweden this year, with the final on 14 May.  Pre-ordered CDs will include the Romanian entry and Romanian press and fans will still be able to attend the contest in Stockholm, but will be moved to sit with the international delegation for non-participating countries, a spokesman said. The ruling may also affect whether Televiziunea Romana can broadcast Euro 2016 and this summers Olympic Games in Rio."

That as a nation, we believe Romanians are <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><c5><93>aggressive<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><c2><9d> and <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><c5><93>lazy<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><c2><9d>. That hardly any of us have actually been there (fewer than 1% in the last five years). And a massive 58% of us believe that Romania is one of the five EU nations that has sent the most migrants to the UK.</p> <p>Which may give some clue as to what<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>s going on here. Because it turns out that not only do we know hardly anything about Romania but what we do know isn<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>t even true. In fact, there are fewer than 100,000 Romanians in Britain. (Compared with nearly 700,000 Poles, for example). Figures from 2014 show that fewer than 2,500 of them claimed benefits here. They are overwhelmingly net contributors to the British economy.</p> <p>To say that Romania has had a poor press in Britain is a bit like saying that Nicolae Ceau<c3><83><e2><80><a6><c3><82><c5><b8>escu was slightly to the left of Jeremy Corbyn. But then, at a hip cafe in downtown Bucharest, Cristian Lup<c3><83><e2><80><a6><c3><82><c5><b8>a, the editor of a pioneering magazine, <a href=""http://www.decatorevista.ro/english-dor/"" title=""""><em>Dec<c3><83><c6><92><c3><82><c2><a2>t o Revist<c3><83><e2><80><9e><c3><82><c6><92></em></a>, reminds me of the press coverage that accompanied the news that Romanians and Bulgarians were going to be allowed to work in Britain in January of last year. <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><c5><93>It was crazy.

And the bad news, he asks? I pause. That, according to the Observers survey, most Brits believe that Romanians come to Britain to steal our jobs and get their teeth fixed on the NHS. In fact, the survey doesnt say that, exactly, but its not far off. It says that of all the countries in Europe in which we would least like to live, the very worst place  cited by a massive 25% of all respondents, leaps and bounds ahead of anywhere else  is Romania. That as a nation, we believe Romanians are aggressive and lazy. That hardly any of us have actually been there (fewer than 1% in the last five years). And a massive 58% of us believe that Romania is one of the five EU nations that has sent the most migrants to the UK. Which may give some clue as to whats going on here. Because it turns out that not only do we know hardly anything about Romania but what we do know isnt even true. In fact, there are fewer than 100,000 Romanians in Britain. (Compared with nearly 700,000 Poles, for example). Figures from 2014 show that fewer than 2,500 of them claimed benefits here. They are overwhelmingly net contributors to the British economy. To say that Romania has had a poor press in Britain is a bit like saying that Nicolae Ceauescu was slightly to the left of Jeremy Corbyn. But then, at a hip cafe in downtown Bucharest, Cristian Lupa, the editor of a pioneering magazine, Dect o Revist, reminds me of the press coverage that accompanied the news that Romanians and Bulgarians were going to be allowed to work in Britain in January of last year. It was crazy. There was this panic that the Romanians would invade. It seems like a long time ago given what has happened in Europe since, but at the time the threat of a tidal wave of Romanian immigrants dominated headlines for months, prompting outpourings from Nigel Farage, questions in the Commons, and an entire primetime Channel 4 series, which sparked protests outside the British embassy in Bucharest. It had this very alarmist title, Lupa says. The Romanians Are Coming  and it really played on these stereotypes. They followed this very poor man who had nine kids and didnt speak English who came to try and find work in Britain. They werent really looking for the people who are creating branding campaigns in London. I catch up on the first episode when Im back in Britain and I see what he means. It features Gypsy beggars and a man getting his teeth fixed on the NHS. There was an attempt at some balance, but balance in the TV sense, so it included an episode on a Romanian princess. But then, theres the basic confusion in Britain over who Romanians actually are, Lupa tells me. Most people in Britain dont understand the difference between Roma people  Gypsies  and Romanians  citizens of Romania. The two are endlessly conflated and confused not least because many Roma are Romanians  the country is home to the biggest population in Europe. A lot of people here get angry when some Roma go abroad and something bad happens. They feel like they are giving the country a bad name. It speaks to some deep prejudices that exist here. Racism and embedded prejudice. In fact, Britain is just late to the party on this one. For centuries, all over Europe, Roma have been despised, discriminated against, excluded and, in the second world war, exterminated. In some ways were just playing catch-up. Do we really have such a negative view of Romanians? Or, have we just acquired one of Europes most ancient prejudices? Is it Gypsy-bashing by another name? Whatever it is, it makes Andrei Tarnea uncomfortable. Hes the director of the Aspen Institute in Romania, an American nonprofit group, but tells me how he started out working in the foreign ministry in the 1990s. And these very nice people who I came to know very well  very ordinary, decent people  displayed this very casual antisemitism all the time. It struck Tarnea because, though they didnt know it, he is a Jew, one of very few left in Romania  those who werent killed in the Holocaust left in communist times. One of my biggest fears is that the anti-Roma sentiment in Europe today very strongly mirrors what was going in the 1930s. Hes something of a passionate European, Tarnea, and hes already been talking fluently on the subject for an hour but he also cant keep the agitation out of his voice. Its not just the things that Ukip says, or the Front National in France, but mainstream publications too. You hear the same discourse about foreigners, Romanians etc. And the gusto with which certain politicians use it for political ends, its very similar. Dont forget that the first fascist government in Europe wasnt Germany; it was, like now, in Hungary. It might sound ridiculous. But I have this almost irrational belief  well, its not irrational, its actually perfectly rational  that certain toxic ideas take on a life of their own. I feel Europe is at a turning point. And Britain staying in or [going] out may be a defining factor. Its striking how many Romanians are well informed on Brexit. But then, the idea of voluntarily exiting the union in which they were only recently accepted is preposterous. It would be ridiculous for us. We were not part of Europe for 50 years, an investment banker called Matei Paun tells me. To be very blunt, it just seems that in Britain theres a considerable amount of hubris and arrogance involved. Its a very myopic view of the world and whats happening. Of course, the idea that Romanians love Europe will simply reinforce the idea, for some people, that youre living high on the hog, and were paying for it, I say. Thats because its never been properly explained that Romanias 20million consumers is a good thing for UK firms, let alone 100 million eastern Europeans. But then, history  and the traumatic effects of Europes recent history  is a whole lot closer to the surface in Romania than it is Britain. Its still dealing with the consequences of the second world war and its aftermath in very direct ways. Philip  Ceallaigh, an Irish writer who lives in Bucharest, tells me how different those born in the 1990s are from the generation that preceded them. They have no idea. Which is great. They are healthy. They really are no different from young people in western Europe whereas their parents are a different species. They were totally traumatised and still are to a degree. I know what he means. I went to Romania in the winter of 1991, and of all the post-Soviet hellholes I visited during that period, the country seemed stuck in a different category of bleakness. Ive never been anywhere where people just looked so beaten down and depressed. One of the saddest people Ive ever encountered was a small boy on a Bucharest metro train who came barefoot into our carriage and played what sounded like a funeral dirge on his violin. But the city really has changed. Its 19th-century buildings have been spruced up, you can take an English-speaking Uber driver instead of fighting to the death over the fare with a chain-smoking taxi driver, and then there are the hipsters. Pulled pork has arrived, Lupa tells me.  Ceallaigh went in the 1990s when such things appeared to be impossible fantasies and has been there more or less ever since. I knew I wanted to be a writer and theres no way I could afford to be one in Dublin. You can live very comfortably here on not much money. Hes just published an essay in Granta about the Bucharest that Ceauescu swept away  a third of the old city was bulldozed, six square kilometres, home to 57,000 people, including the entire Jewish quarter. It seems like its quite a frivolous debate in Britain. Britain doesnt really need the EU and the EU doesnt really need Britain. It wasnt ruined by the 20th century in the way that most of the rest of Europe, and all of eastern Europe was. People tend to overlook how the EU came into existence. Everyone was killing each other and the continent was in ruins. Its given us a generation of peace. Countries that were at war in the 1990s  in the former Yugoslavia  no longer are. Without the EU, Romania would have gone the way of Russia or Egypt. There was no institutional basis for democracy.  Ceallaighs new book is on European writers of the interwar period  all Jewish  when Bucharest, a multicultural city nicknamed the Paris of the east bloomed, and hes been immersed in the period. The thing, as now, is that people took it for granted. They lived in an enlightened culture and they simply couldnt envisage the kind of regimes that followed. We live in a similarly enlightened culture and we cant conceive it either. Later, I walk around Bucharest talking to young people involved in the creative arts  all over Bucharest there are people doing interesting things and they all tell me how much easier it is to do things here, how much more impact they can have, how dynamic the city is in some ways compared to western Europe  and it takes me a good 20 minutes to walk along the pavement that runs the length of the parliament building, the monstrous palace that Ceauescu built that was the centrepiece of his new city. Its still as grim as I remember it being. A daily reminder of what happens when you get caught on the wrong side of history. Its not surprising that the debate about Europe looks so different from here. Just look at the neighbours: a collapsing Ukraine is right next door. I think Europe is losing its soul, Andrei Tarnea tells me. In Britain, the discussion stops at the wallet and the ballot box. The questions simply look bigger from here. Theres a lone tourist taking a photograph of the palace. Because while the city has its attractions and theres been some hopeful talk of Bucharest being the new Berlin, nobody I meet actually manages to say it with a straight face, and most tourists head straight to Transylvania, home to Dracula, and also, intermittently, Prince Charles. He owns a couple of guesthouses there and has set up a Romanian foundation. John Akeroyd, a naturalist who has accompanied him on his forays into the Romanian countryside, tells me that its the last place in Europe that has the same extensive landscape that existed in the 18th century or even medieval times. Its probably why Prince Charles likes it. Its like the Cotswolds would have been in the 18th century. But then according to Michael Bird, an English journalist who runs an investigative website based in Bucharest, Romania tends to inspire two extreme reactions in the British press. Either its a hellhole for the rightwing press. Or it has this mysterious romanticism. Its where the middle ages meets totalitarianism. Nineteen Eighty-Four meets Game of Thrones. Back in London, in my local coffee shop, I chat to the only Romanian I know, Mike  actually Mihai  the friendly barista. Is it true we have a negative view of Romanians? You do but its understandable. Understandable? People see these guys begging. Who wants that? On the other hand, its mostly ignorance. People say, Theyre taking our jobs! Dude, if you want the job, its yours. Come and do it."

Inevitably accompanied by a narrative of post-Ceausescu optimism, the reviled ruler having been toppled only six months previously, Romania stepped out of the shadows at Italia 90, reaching the knockout stages for the first time, where they dominated but were unable to break down Jack Charlton<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>s Republic of Ireland at their most obdurately Charlton-esque, losing on penalties. Only one of their squad played outside Romania; by 1994, eight did, including the captain, Hagi, at Brescia, Florin Raducioiu at Milan and Dan Petrescu at Genoa.

The first major tournament of the Champions League/Premier League era, it showcased an emerging globalisation of the game at a time when prevailing attitudes were simultaneously becoming more outward-looking yet more elitist, hence the unmerited fawning over the easily marketable Brazil and Italy as <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><c5><93>dream finalists<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><c2><9d> during the tournament.

For a whole swathe of fans, Brazils beautiful losers of 1982 were formative, in both opening their eyes to a whole new way in which the game could be played and in giving the brutal lesson that such teams usually fall short, often in heartbreaking fashion. That team of Zico, Falco, Eder et al became the standard-bearers of a certain type of poignant choke but there are others less celebrated: France in 1986 maybe; Argentina in 2006; perhaps even Ghana in 2010, denied a semi-final slot by Luis Surezs sleight of hand.  Related: Golden Goal: Cristiano Ronaldo for Manchester United v Arsenal (2009) | Rob Smyth  However, perhaps the most undeservedly unsung of all World Cup romantic failures distinguished themselves in the next showpiece following the 82 heartache that Brazil actually won  USA 94. They wore yellow, they attacked with dash and panache, they were cajoled by an extravagantly gifted superstar-playmaker, they supplied the tournaments best match and goal  and they fell short, agonisingly, on penalties. Not Brazil, of course  corporately hyped but functional and unattractive champions  but the Gheorghe Hagi-inspired Romanians, who peaked just a little too soon in their second-round 3-2 win over Argentina, a match that has probably not been bettered in the knockout stages of a World Cup since. Romanias emergence had been evident at the previous World Cup. Inevitably accompanied by a narrative of post-Ceausescu optimism, the reviled ruler having been toppled only six months previously, Romania stepped out of the shadows at Italia 90, reaching the knockout stages for the first time, where they dominated but were unable to break down Jack Charltons Republic of Ireland at their most obdurately Charlton-esque, losing on penalties. Only one of their squad played outside Romania; by 1994, eight did, including the captain, Hagi, at Brescia, Florin Raducioiu at Milan and Dan Petrescu at Genoa. The well-regarded coach Anghel Iordanescu, a European Cup winner with Steaua Bucharest in 1986, had plenty to work with, then, when he took the reins in 1993. The 1994 World Cup came at an intriguingly transitional moment in modern footballs evolution. The first major tournament of the Champions League/Premier League era, it showcased an emerging globalisation of the game at a time when prevailing attitudes were simultaneously becoming more outward-looking yet more elitist, hence the unmerited fawning over the easily marketable Brazil and Italy as dream finalists during the tournament. Tactics were changing, styles were changing  mostly for the better after the turgid Italia 90 and the recalibration ushered in by the introduction of the backpass rule in 1992. Although England were absent  and not remotely missed  USA 94 would stamp its mark all over the Premier League, most obviously in the slew of not always successful signings made by English clubs of many of its star performers. Which brings us back to Ilie Dumitrescu and Romania  unheralded, unmarketed and the most attractive side of the tournament by some distance, until they fell at the quarter-final stage. They could have fallen much earlier. The roots of their romantic story began with the thwarting of another  Waless charge for a first finals place since 1958. Qualification was sealed amid drama and tragedy in Cardiff in November 1993, Romania winning their final qualifier 2-1 with goals from Hagi and Raducioiu, a victory that owed much to Paul Bodins pivotal penalty miss at 1-1 in a match overshadowed by the death of a fan, John Hill, who was hit by a flare fired across the Arms Park stands after the match. Romania had played wonderfully well that evening and were deserved winners but their excellence did not receive much attention amid the matchs flurry of talking points. Thus was an under-the-radar pattern established. The draw for the finals pitted them against Colombia, USA and Switzerland, with Colombia up first in Los Angeles. If any team were the dark-horse picks going into the tournament, they were Colombia. Celebrated 5-0 maulers of Argentina a year earlier, the team of Carlos Valderrama, Tino Asprilla and co promised much and on 18 June, a day that had already produced one of the great World Cup occasions  Irelands 1-0 win over Italy in a New York turned raucously green in celebration  Colombia v Romania was set to provide the most invigorating of nightcaps. Which it did  but not in the manner forecast. Romania, playing with speed and verve on the counterattack, won 3-1, Hagis speculative/stunning long-range effort from wide on the left touchline the highlight of a terrific performance. (As in Cardiff seven months earlier, tangential but genuine tragedy was to accompany Romanian progress here, too  Colombias first-round exit was followed by the murder of their defender Andrs Escobar, scorer of an own goal in their defeat by the USA in their second match). If victory at the Rose Bowl flagged up Romanias potential as the new dark horses, their second match suggested where it might all go wrong: a second-half collapse in the sweltering indoor Silverdome in Detroit gave Switzerland a 4-1 win, which left Romania needing at least a point to progress. Their final group opponents: the newly cock-a-hoop hosts, buoyed by the win over Colombia and a creditable draw with the Swiss in their opener. But Romania squeaked through, eking out a 1-0 win through a smart Hagi-engineered goal on the break that was to prove a portent of greater highs to come, Petrescu providing the finish with a low, angled shot that caught out the USA goalkeeper, Tony Meola, at the near post. Victory ensured Romania topped their group, earning a second-round tie against Argentina, one of the four best third-placed teams in the convoluted 24-team format. Some vague semblance of wordcount discipline dictates that we must not divert too deeply into the colourful details of Argentinas own campaign but some context is certainly required. Memories of Argentinas ugly contribution to the 1990 final  and that of their tearful and sulky captain Diego Maradona that night in Rome  hung heavily over the two-times winners at the start of USA 94, and their reputation in the eyes of many, particularly an English media still wont to play the aggrieved Hand of God card, lay unsalvaged.   Related: Golden Goal: Ken McNaught for Aston Villa v Barcelona (1982 Super Cup) | Paul Doyle  However, they came out of the blocks with a swagger in the States, blitzing Greece 4-0 thanks to a turbo-charged Maradona display, and securing progress to the knockout stage with a 2-1 win over an impressive Nigeria in an excellent match in Boston, after which their momentum was jolted when Maradona failed a drugs test for ephedrine doping and was booted out of the tournament, the dream of a golden career-autumn signoff for the games greatest player ignominiously destroyed. Argentina duly lost their third game, 0-2 to the tournaments other great dark horses, Bulgaria, which consigned them to third place in their group  and a second-round meeting with Romania. Argentina remained the favourites but there was a sense that the momentum was with Romania for the tie at the Rose Bowl, although the latter would be without the suspended striker Raducioiu. Maradonas departure inevitably cast its shadow. Yet this was still a positive and inventive Argentinian side, who through talents such as Gabriel Batistuta, Fernando Redondo and the emerging Ariel Ortega, could take a game to anyone, as they did in the opening stages on this occasion in Pasadena. However, Romanias counterattacking  as canny as it was easy on the eye  had their measure and they drew first blood in the 11th minute. Steaua Bucharests Dumitrescu  pushed into a more attacking role for this match by Raducioius absence  curled a free-kick from the left into the opposite corner after the goalkeeper Luis Islas was spotted off his line, to register his first goal of the tournament. Argentinas response was swift, Batistuta winning and converting a debatable penalty five minutes later after being nudged off the ball by Daniel Prodan near the byline. A breathless pattern of attack and counterattack was thereby established, a pattern that suited Romania perfectly and through which they regained the lead after 18 minutes with the most exquisitely subtle goal of the World Cup. Back then, goal of the tournament contenders were  and indeed mainly still are  generally believed to fall into two broad categories: the dazzling solo effort or the thunderous and unstoppable long-range howitzer. Goals that come from a casually dinked finish just outside the six-yard box past a haplessly wrongfooted goalkeeper tick neither box. Yet Dumitrescus effort surpassed all others scored that summer, and crystallised all his teams strengths. The move began deep in Romanias half with the dispossession of Redondo, effectively closed down and crowded out, and enabling Petrescu to pick up possession. He worked it wide on the right to Hagi, who produced his first magical contribution to the move by clipping the ball beyond two markers into space for the onrushing Dumitrescu, who swiftly returned it to the captain back out on the right touchline. Hagi, by now almost level with the penalty area, faced a wall of four Argentinian defenders as he advanced and prepared to cross.  Had a photographer been behind his eyeline, they could have snapped something akin to the celebrated shot of a lone Maradona confronting a solid line of Belgian opponents in 1982. The Maradona of the Carpathians  the somewhat stilted nickname bestowed upon Hagi  had the game in the palm of his hand, though. A master of adjusting the pace of play to his requirements, he spotted that Dumitrescu had continued his run and conjured the most majestic and precise low curved cross that took out all four defenders and ran perfectly into the path of his unmarked and onside team-mate  a genius pass, said Dumitrescu afterwards. The back line carved apart, Dumitrescu played his part by keeping nerve and head and artfully wrongfooting Chamot with a delightful, almost gentle, near-post finish that nestled in the left-hand corner of the goalkeepers net. This was no fluke, this was the team of the moment elegantly taking control. There was also a nonchalant class to Romanias third goal in the 58th minute  another breakaway, another piece of Hagi-Dumitrescu telepathy, the latter turning creator this time, delaying his rolled path into Hagis path with almost contemptuous ease for the captain to belt the ball into the roof of the net. Abel Balbo pulled one back for Argentina with a quarter of an hour remaining to set up the kind of compelling, nervous finish that cemented the matchs classic status  but Romania held on. Romania are fast emerging as the surprise team of the tournament and Hagi its outstanding individual, Paul Wilson wrote in the following days Guardian. And yet, and yet  they couldnt build on it. Paired with Sweden in the quarter-finals, in the first match of the finals in which they could truly be adjudged favourites, Romania never quite found the same fluency, although they still played their part in a gripping tie that went to extra-time at 1-1, and when Raducioius second goal of the match put them ahead after 101 minutes, the dream looked set to continue. However, Kennet Anderson struck with five minutes remaining, Sweden won 5-4 on penalties and USA 94 had seen the last of Hagis glorious side. Romania never rescaled the heights reached in that golden summer, although they remained a creditable international side for the remainder of that decade, beating and outpassing England en route to making the knockout stages at both France 98 and Euro 2000. Dumitrescu (Tottenham and West Ham) and Raducioiu (West Ham) had fitful stints in the Premier League on the back of their performances in the US, while Petrescu became a consistent high-end performer at Chelsea. Iordanescu, meanwhile, is now back in charge of the national team going into this years expanded European Championship  his third stint as national coach  but his side go to France 2016 as rank outsiders, exciting little optimism; the days in which his country were standard-bearers for a renascent eastern Europe long gone. Indeed, only two eastern European sides have reached the last eight of the World Cup since the heady days of USA 94  Croatia in 1998 and Ukraine eight years later. The recent sad death of the Trifon Ivanov, uncompromising stalwart of the charismatic Bulgaria side that knocked out Germany and reached the semi-finals in the States, stirred further fond memories of a tournament that still divides opinion. One of the reasons it does is that USA 94 began to unravel a little after its quarter-finals. Romanias departure deprived us of what would have been a fascinating, defining match between Old Brazil and New Brazil in the semi-finals, and perhaps after that a final against the Roberto-Baggio-and-10-others combination that had somehow staggered into the final in the Azzurri shirts of Italy.

Related: Marek Hamsiks sumptuous strike gives Slovakia the edge over Russia  They did not manage to emulate Alain Sutter and the class of 94 in terms of the result or performance but, in this expanded championship, where so few teams fall at the group phase, the draw  on the back of their 1-0 victory over Albania last Saturday  ought to be enough to send them through. Switzerland were the better team, they were the more forward-thinking and, after the criticism that followed the disjointed performance against Albania, who had played for most of the game with 10 men, Petkovic could feel happier. This was a glimpse of the teams potential and in Granit Xhaka, Arsenals new midfield signing, Switzerland had the games outstanding talent. It was a pleasure to watch his range of passing. Like all of the best players Xhaka seems to have an extra second or two on the ball, before any tackles come in on him. The downside was Switzerlands profligacy. They created a clutch of presentable chances only for a mixture of poor finishing and the reactions of Ciprian Tatarusanu, the Romania goalkeeper, to thwart them. We will not create eight good chances against France, Xhaka said, looking ahead to his teams final Group A tie. We have to start scoring. It is the last wheel in our system. Switzerlands goal was a beauty and it came from Admir Mehmedi, after Ricardo Rodrguezs corner had ricocheted off Johan Djourou. Mehmedis technique was perfect and his left-foot shot flew into the far corner of the net. It cancelled out Bogdan Stancus 18th-minute penalty for a Romania team who could also have regrets, not least in the shape of the two clear chances they passed up midway though the first half.

Now they are two games in, the feeling must be some way different. Before an eminently winnable group closer against Romania a sense of what might have been has crept in. The Switzerland match, where they fell behind early on but created numerous chances, slipped away on account of the captain Lorik Canas entirely avoidable sending off in the first half. Against France they defended brilliantly for 89 minutes before breaking at the death, conceding twice for a largely undeserved 2-0 defeat.  Related: Euro 2016: France into last 16 after late show against Albania  My team resisted right until the end but we didnt defend throughout, especially in the first half and at the start of the second, De Biasi said. When you dont take your chances and score goals, you dont get big results. My team held up pretty well and were disappointed to concede a goal a minute from the end. Albania still retain a slim chance of progressing to the last 16, though it appears unlikely. To do so would require a heavy win to ensure a positive goal difference. And even then they would have to watch the other groups play to completion, hoping that two third-placed sides finish with weaker records. While De Biasi says I believe we can qualify, Romanias defence does not look like giving too many chances away. Though they have conceded twice to France and once to Switzerland, Anghel Iordanescus team  shipping just two goals in qualifying  are renowned for their rearguard.

If France beat Switzerland and Romania win, then Romania could go through in second depending on goal difference. No wonder, then, the striker Florin Andone has descended into hyperbole. He has described this match as a matter of life and death. Andone was dropped for the 1-1 draw against Switzerland but is in line for a recall in Lyon after his replacement, Claudiu Keseru, disappointed. We must show the mentality of winners against Albania, he told Romanias Digi Sport television. It will be very difficult because Albania are a very good team, they run a lot and are very aggressive. But we are aware that a victory could send us through so we will give it a 100% effort. The now or never stakes promise a more attacking game, with both managers expected to change personnel and, in Albanias case, shape. Andone is likely to lead Romanias 4-2-3-1, with Ovidiu Hoban tipped to start in midfield in place of the injured Mihai Pintilii. Cana will return to Albanias defence but, most notably, De Biasi is tempted to return to a 4-3-3 after packing midfield with five players for France.

Chiriches role is fundamental, believes the manager, Anghel Iordanescu, although the 26-year-old does not want to place too much pressure on his own shoulders. The generation Im part of has an asset  the unity inside the group, he says. Im not one for making statements; I just need to stay focused. It would be a mistake to think of anything other than my game. His impact in the Premier League and, latterly, Serie A might not have been the most positive  Chiriches has started just 18 league games in the last two seasons  but he has retained his aura in the national team. Romanias defence is their selling point; they conceded just twice during the qualifying campaign, fewer than anyone else, and the commanding centre-back was at the heart of that achievement. Perhaps it helps that Chiriches is used to getting straight back up after being hit. He spent a season as a youth player at Benfica but was forced to return home after a series of bad injuries, at one point fearing that his career would not get off the ground. I was afraid football was over for me, Chiriches says. But I went down to the second division, put the effort in and gave my all to return to the level I was at before. God helped me with my every decision. I was training with Benficas first team and then two injuries ended everything for me  but that didnt destroy me. He might not have managed it without the motivating presence of one family member. My mother was very important  she helped me a lot and said I would come back, he says. And it was exactly as she said. I owe her a lot. She was the one who insisted I took my school studies seriously too, and I was very good in maths and history. Football was always the ambition though, even if it took time to settle into life as a central defender. I was a left midfielder when I was a kid, he explains. I started when I was eight, then I left home for good at 14. Thats the sacrifice I had to make as a kid in order to become a professional. I had nothing guaranteed; I was only a child with a dream. I had to live away from my family and that hurt, but it was worth it. Chiriches fall from grace at Tottenham was sudden. He went from being man of the match in a 2-1 win at Old Trafford on 1 January 2014 to backup status in under six months. A back injury did not help; nor did a change of managers at his club and perhaps video footage of him falling over, seemingly drunk, in the snow back in his homeland did not count in his favour either. Whatever the cause, he fell out of favour and never hit the same heights again. I wasnt playing, so I wasnt happy, he says. The defenders subsequent move to the right side of the defence did not help and he made just three appearances for Tottenham in the second half of the 2014-15 season  although it did not harm his position in the Romania team. The national team gave me so much, he says. It is all about the pride and joy you feel when you play for your country. Its always immense to be among those selected and I enjoy every minute of it. Being here helped me stay focused and our results gave great satisfaction. Chiriches can expect to wear the captains armband in Paris on 10 June when Romania open the tournament against host nation France. The Romania dressing room is abuzz with delight rather than fear. France will be tough and playing at home makes them even tougher, he says. Im dreaming of making a historical performance, but I know how difficult this will be. We are fighting for our country and for our dreams, and nobody can take that away. Chiriches central defensive partnership with Dragos Grigore has been the bedrock of Iordanescus team throughout qualifying. When he arrived in the Premier League, Chiriches was known for his ability to come out of defence with the ball. He was forced to adapt his style in England and such forays were rarely seen; there are no such restrictions in the national team, though, and his offensive raids often launch dangerous attacks. Despite Chiriches enthusiasm for marauding upfield, Romanias current style of play rarely demonstrates a great appetite for attacking. They put on an encouraging performance in a 0-0 draw with Spain in March, though, and that served as a spectacular confidence boost for players and fans alike. Against the reigning European champions, Iordanescus men put on an electric display and would not have been flattered by a win. The generation Im part of made it to France thanks to a major collective effort, says Chiriches. It guided us throughout the qualifying campaign, and this unity is our main asset. I hope it helps us now, as it has done so far. Going to France for the final tournament cannot be compared to anything else, and we hope to do things the right way. A good performance could help provide a new perspective on Romania as a nation. At his best, Chiriches might just help make that happen. His 8.5m move to Tottenham from Steaua Bucharest in 2013 set a Romanian league transfer record with his skill, use of the ball and comfort in possession setting a new standard for centre-backs in the country. He scored spectacular goals against Ajax and Molde in the Europa League, while his elegance and creativity were such that Steaua changed their tactics to allow him the freedom his talent merited. Now he goes to Euro 2016 with the aim of showing the world a new version of Romanian brilliance  perhaps not the same kind which the likes of Gheorghe Hagi, Adrian Ilie, Dan Petrescu or Adrian Mutu displayed, but one based on a collective strength that could be the envy of its peers. These are the occasions that make you fall in love with football, he says. I cant wait for the tournament to begin. Down there, on the pitch, the joy of playing will be huge for all of us. Well have an entire nation behind us, well all be Romania and if we stay together we are capable of doing big things  trust me.  Emanuel Rosu writes for sport.ro. Follow him on Twitter here.

They first took their son to play with the familys football team when he was six. At the age of eight or nine, my father told me I should be a goalkeeper, because I am pretty tall and it should be easier, Pantililon remembers. He now stands at 6ft 8in. After becoming a professional, he always made sure to send money to his parents and still goes on holiday with them sometimes. Pantilimons father rarely attends his matches but brought good luck when he did, seeing Poli Timisoara beat Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League third qualifying round in 2009. I thank my parents for all they did and still do for me, he says. The fact that they are deaf has never affected me at all. When I am away, we keep in touch by SMS and via the internet. Gabriel Torje  Born in Timisoara, Torje was brought into the local top-flight team by Gheorghe Hagi, the coach at the time, who saw big potential in the 16-year-old. He then signed for one of Timisoaras big rivals, Dinamo Bucharest, who bragged at the time: We got their heart. A few years later he caused controversy when caught on camera at a party singing a song in support of Dinamos fierce city rivals, Steaua, which went: Steaua is the only one, all the world should know this. To confuse matters further he then cried when Dinamo lost a cup final to Steaua, causing the Steaua fans to devise a song along the lines of Cry, Torje, cry. He is not into electronic football games like Fifa, but does play a lot of Call of Duty on his computer. Razvan Rat Rat is an avid wine collector, a hobby he began while playing for Shakhtar Donetsk in Ukraine  where he met his wife, too. He grew up in a small Romanian town, Piatra-Olt, where he watched the countrys legendary 1994 World Cup campaign at his neighbours house because his family did not have a television. These days, he loves fast cars and owns two Ferraris. Nicolae Stanciu  Stanciu is the national teams newest star  but doesnt like it if you call him Nicusor, which is a diminutive of Nicolae. When he returned home from his first ever game of football as a boy he was upset, complaining: Nobody passes to me. At home, he helped his parents work in agriculture. We didnt take him in order to work, but just so that he wasnt left alone. He always ran off to play football, though, remembers his mother. Indeed, sometimes Stanciu left home at 6am, took a 15km bus ride to the nearest city, and returned at 9pm. He asked for his bedroom to be painted in red and blue with the logo of his favourite team Steaua  for whom he now plays. In the past, he was passionate about fruit machines and sports betting.

Giroud starts at centre-forward with Payet and Greizmann either side of him. Martial and Coman will be introduced from the bench if France need a goal or feel like showing off. The inclusion of Kant<c3><83><c6><92><c3><82><c2><a9> in the place vacated by the injured Diarra, is the wisest move: not only will he protect a defence that needs it and try to shut down Romania<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>s tricky schemer Nicolae Stanciu, but he<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>ll also give Pogba more freedom to go forward. Pogba hasn<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>t been great for France recently so expecting him to impact this tournament the way Platini and Zidane did in the past may be too much: after all, he<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>s only 23, Zidane had barely been capped at the same age and, what<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>s more, he wasn<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>t actually brilliant in the <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><cb><9c>98 World Cup even if he did head two goals in the final.

After 266 qualifying matches, several weeks of rehearsals and a million selection squabbles, the 2016 European Championships is kicking off in Paris and it promises to be a lot of fun. The tournament<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>s cast has never been so big and while expansion to 24 participants means watering down the quality, drama is still guaranteed. There<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>s no telling how things will pan out over the next month. If the stars are properly aligned by Roy Hodgson, even England have an earthly. A competition with no flawless team looks perfectly unpredictable. A handful of countries can realistically aspire to outright victory <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> including Poland and Austria <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> but four sides start with stronger credentials than the rest: the holders (Spain), the world champions (Germany), the highest-ranked team (Belgium) and the hosts, France, who get things under way this evening against Romania, who were unbeaten during the qualifiers and only conceded two goals. They even kept Kyle Lafferty quiet. </p> <p>France, of course, won the last two major tournaments that they staged <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> the 1984 European Championships and the 1998 World Cup <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> and that<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>s no easy feat, as evidenced by the fact that it has been nearly four decades since any other host won either competition (Argentina <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><cb><9c>78). But of course it was much more than home advantage that brought those victories to France: on both occasions Les Bleus had bloody good teams. Can we say the same about them now? Well that<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>s what we<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>re here to find out. They sure have some exciting ingredients but they<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>re all in attack: their defence is vulnerable, although being able to field Laurent Koscielny and Adil Rami is actually an indication of France<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>s strength in depth in central defence: what other country would be able to pick a duo as decent as that after losing five players (Varane, Sakho, Laporte, Mathieu and Zouma) who would have been picked ahead of at least one of them? And looking at the calibre of attacking players that Deschamps has chosen to omit (Ben Arfa, Lacazette, Gameiro...) gives an indication of the awesome strike power that they he have called up: if Roman<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>s defence can stifle the likes of Greizmann, Payet, Pogba, Martial, Comon and potential golden boot winner Giroud, then they really are exceptional. Can<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>t see it myself, mind. Then again, France know all too well what it<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>s like to be shocked in their opening match, thanks to Senegal. </p> </div>   <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2016-06-10T17:30:33.858Z"">at 6.30pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=""block-575aba52e4b01a5ff948b645"" class=""block is-key-event"" data-block-contributor=""""> <p class=""block-time published-time""> <time datetime=""2016-06-10T13:03:31.817Z"">2.03pm <span class=""timezone"">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=""block-title"">Teams:</h2>  <div class=""block-elements"">  <p><strong>France</strong>: Lloris; Sagna, Rami, Koscileny, Evra; Matuidi, Pogba, Kant<c3><83><c6><92><c3><82><c2><a9>; Payet, Giroud, Greizmann</p> <p><strong>Romania</strong>: T<c3><83><e2><80><9e><c3><82><c6><92>t<c3><83><e2><80><9e><c3><82><c6><92>ru<c3><83><e2><80><a6><c3><82><c5><b8>anu; S<c3><83><e2><80><9e><c3><82><c6><92>punaru, Grigore, Chiriche<c3><83><e2><80><a6><c3><82><c5><b8>, Ra<c3><83><e2><80><a6><c3><82><c2><a3>; Hoban, Pintilii; Stanciu, Popa, Stancu; Andone</p> <p><strong>Referee</strong>: Viktor Kassai (Hun)</p>       <figure class=""element element-video"" data-canonical-url=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/jun/10/euro-2016-venue-guide-stade-de-france-paris-video""            data-short-url=""http://gu.com/p/4kqdd""                    data-show-ads=""true""            data-video-id=""2538742""            data-video-name=""Euro 2016 venue guide: Stade de France, Paris <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> video""            data-video-provider=""guardian.co.uk""            > <video data-media-id=""gu-video-575ac17ce4b01a5ff948b65f"" class=""gu-video"" controls=""controls"" poster=""""> <source src=""https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11585585&amp;format=video/mp4""/><source src=""https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11585585&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700""/><source src=""https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11585585&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700""/><source src=""https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/06/10/160610StadeFrance1_synd_768k_vp8.webm""/><source src=""https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11585585&amp;format=video/m3u8""/> </video> <figcaption><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/jun/10/euro-2016-venue-guide-stade-de-france-paris-video"">Euro 2016 venue guide: Stade de France, Paris</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>For Barney Ronay<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>s take on tonight<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>s opening game, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/jun/09/euro-2016-france-security-fears-didier-deschamps-favourites"">click here</a>. </p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/jun/09/euro-2016-france-security-fears-didier-deschamps-favourites"">France takes deep breath as Deschamps<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2> favourites make Euro 2016 entrance | Barney Ronay</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=""block-time updated-time"">Updated <time datetime=""2016-06-10T18:10:14.139Z"">at 7.10pm BST</time></p>  </div>",2016," 9.56pm BST Mission accomplished by France, who blended slickness and jitters throughout but were uplifted at the last by Payet, their best player on the night and the scorer of a superb winning goal. Thats a nice start for the hosts to build on, even if plenty of improvement will be needed for them to win here on July 10.   Related: Dimitri Payets stunner rescues Frances welcome party against Romania  Updated at 10.13pm BST  9.53pm BST 90+3 min: Matuidi releases Sissoko. He could announce his arrival in stye here ... but instead blasts a 20-yard shot wide.   9.51pm BST France substitution: Payet ambles off to tumultuous acclaim and sudden national hero status. His replacements wanders on. From the sublime to Moussa Sissoko.   9.50pm BST He was the man of the match even before he received a clever short pass from Kant at the edge of the area - and jinked to his left and curled a sumptuous shot into the top corner! This time last year it didnt even look like hed be picked for the tournament, now it looks like hes won the opening match with a sumptuous goal!  Updated at 10.18pm BST  9.46pm BST 85 min: With a cheeky flash of skill Alibec wrongfoots two Frenchman and bears down on their defence. He briefly considers letting fly from 25 yards but instead flips the ball wide to Stancu, who loses it.   9.44pm BST 83 min: ... or for Grigore to bound offside and let them off.   9.43pm BST 83 min: Kant takes down Torje, giving Romania a freekick mid-way inside the French half. Another chance for the hosts to show their setpiece defending prowess...  9.41pm BST Romania substitution: Torje on for Popa.   9.41pm BST 81 min: Martial slaloms in from the left, then rolls the ball to Giroud at the edge of the area. Giroud, holding off the defender behind him, tees up Martial for a shot. But it lacks power and poses no trouble to the keeper.   9.40pm BST 80 min: Theres audible nerves all around the Stade de France, with both sets of fans knowing victory or a miserable defeat are both still very possible. Meanwhile in Marseille, just look what England fans are up to. Some people just shouldnt be allowed out of the house.   9.38pm BST 78 min: Popa booked for pulling back Payet.  Updated at 9.49pm BST  9.37pm BST Heres a curious move: Deschamps has introduced Martial for ... Pogba, who looks momentarily perplexed but then accepts the decision and jogs off, shaking hands with the manager when he reaches the sideline and commissioning a new haircut: Pogbench, perhaps.  Updated at 9.37pm BST  9.36pm BST 76 min: Kant overhits an intended pass to Sagna, and a France attack fizzles out.   9.35pm BST 75 min: Coman has made an impact, and France are on the rise again. Coman and Payet combine nicely on the left before releasing the overlapping Evra, who bangs in a good first-time cross on the run. Giroud tries to sweep it into the net from eight yards but Chiriches beats him to do it bravely.   9.33pm BST Romania substitution: Chipciu on for Stanciu.  9.31pm BST 71 min: Romania arent merely hanging on for a draw: they know Frances defence is there to be exploited. Alibec bustles his way down the left and stabs in a cross that, once again, is dealt with shoddily. No direct punishment, but Romania now have a corner, and France havent been defending them well all night. OK, so they clear this one.   9.28pm BST 69 min: Giroud booked for inadvertently clumping Pintili with an elbow as the pair jumped for a ball. Pintili looks dazed.  Updated at 9.29pm BST  9.28pm BST 68 min: Canny interplay between Coman and Pogba before the latter lifts a nice ball into Giroud. The striker shows good strength to hold off Chiriches and then roll past him ... and fall to the floor.   9.26pm BST France substitution: Coman on for Griezmann, who just didnt look sharp.  9.26pm BST Stancu dupes Lloris and curls a low shot to the keepers left while the keeper leans to the right. Frances lead lasted nine minutes. So what will they do now, rebel or fold?  Updated at 9.35pm BST  9.24pm BST Evra has been a liability all game and has just taken down Stanciu with a senseless tackle.  Updated at 9.33pm BST  9.24pm BST 63 min: Payet delivered flights over a freekick from the right. Giroud gets the jump on the entire Romanian defence and stretches out his left leg to hook the ball back across the face of goal. But Rat scurries back to clear before Pogba pounces.   9.20pm BST Romania substitution: Alibec for Andone.   9.20pm BST 60 min: Sagna hurls himself in front of Rat to cut out a cross but concede a corner. Stanciu delivers an inswinger, and yet again Frances defending is feeble. But Andone heads over.   9.17pm BST And thats why hes started! Giroud outjumps the goalkeeper to meet a delightfully floated cross by Payet and head into the net! Moments prior to that Tatarusanu made an excellent save to turn away a ferocious volley by Pogba after more wizardry from Payet, but the keeper should have done much better in the challenge with Giroud.  Updated at 10.16pm BST  9.15pm BST 54 min: Theres a strong invisible presence on the pitch: its the hole where Karim Benzema would have been if not for, well, whatever.   9.12pm BST 52 min: France have awoken! At least Payet has. He threads a neat pass through to Giroud, who shoots on the run ... but scuffs it badly, offering the keeper an easy save. Updated at 9.23pm BST  9.10pm BST 50 min: France look like they took some sedatives during the break. They were nervous and scatty at times in the first half, but theyve been downright sluggish for all of this one so far. Whats the Romanian for Pape Bouba Diop? Updated at 9.11pm BST  9.09pm BST 48 mins: Its been a great start to the second period by Romania. Pintili does well in midfield to hold of Pogba before playing the ball wide on the right. Its then played back infield to Stanciu, who clips a lovely pass over to Stancu. The striker, having eluded Rami and Koscielny again, kills the ball on his chest and then tries to volley it goalwards from 14 yards while falling backwards. But he fires the shot a couple of yards wide of the far post. Updated at 9.21pm BST  9.06pm BST 46 min: Romania get the second half going, knowing they may be 45 minutes away from a fine start to their tournament. And that could mean a victory rather than just a draw. Andone certainly believes: through sheer will power and he barges his way past Koscielny and almost past Rami, too, and into the box. But Rami just about holds him off and clears the danger.   8.52pm BST Its good to see the relatively unknown Romanians holding their own - so far - against their star-studded hosts, hurrahs Peter Oh. Its the so-called small teams such as Romania and their Ra-to-Chiriche stories that make for some of the most compelling stories of big tournaments. Updated at 9.09pm BST  8.51pm BST His team have had some lovely flourishes but Deschamps will be frustrated at half-time because they have failed to take some decent chances - Griezmann and Giroud both guilty - and they are distinctly brittle in defence. Romania have been stretched close to breaking point a couple of times but they, too, may be frustrated not to be in front, Stancu having had the best chance of the game only to be thwarted by a brilliant reflex save by Lloris. Martial should be introduced soon. Half-time reading:  Related: How France hosted and won Euro 1984 (and British TV ignored the action)  Updated at 9.12pm BST  8.49pm BST 45 min: Thats a better delivery from Payet! From a corner he finds Giroud on the penalty spot. Again the striker did well to make space, but again he failed to find the target.  Updated at 9.00pm BST  8.48pm BST 44 min: Rat booked for thrusting his foot into Girouds chest while trying to intercept a bouncing ball. That gives Payet a chance to deliver another freekick from wide, but again his usual precision is missing. Theres a slight but important scruffiness to France, as if they havent quite attuned to the intensity of a competitive match having played nothing but friendlies for two years.   8.46pm BST 43 min: Payet stands over a freekick way out by the left touchline. Its a terrible delivery but Romania make a meal of clearing it. They are reprieved when Pogba fails to make a proper connection with a half-volley from 10 yards.   8.44pm BST 40 min: A strong, cutting run from deep by Matuidi, who colludes with Payet to take out a whole row of opponents with a one-two. Matuidi then plays the ball wide to Giroud, who had peeled off to the left-hand side of the box. The striker attempts to chip a return pass to Matuidi, who had continued his run, but its intercepted.  Updated at 8.49pm BST  8.42pm BST 38 min: More sloppiness at the back by France, again by Evra. His goofing allowed Romania to hoik a pass forward. Andone scampered on to it, beating Koscileny and Rami for pace. But after leaping to take the bouncing ball on his chest, he gets a clatter from Koscielny and goes down in a heap. It should be a penalty! But the ref saw nothing awry. Fortune favours the hosts.  Updated at 10.16pm BST  8.38pm BST 36 min: Payet hurtles down the right and fires a low cross towards Griezmann, who, running on to it at speed, cracks a first-time shot inches wide!   8.37pm BST 36 min: If things do change, it wont necessarily be in Frances favour: they still look shaky at the back whenever Romania venture forward. And its not just the centrebacks, as Sagna and, in particular, Evra are being bypassed quite easily.   8.36pm BST 34 min: The pace is slowing a bit, because Romania are clogging up play and frustrating their hosts. Expect Giroud to be replaced by Martial of Coman early in the second half if things dont change.   8.34pm BST 31 min: Chiriches gets the first booking of the tournament for lunging through Giroud from behind.  Updated at 9.13pm BST  8.32pm BST 29 min: Dont listen to anyone who tries to put a tag on Frances formation. Theyre a freewheeling outfit who are all about movement: Payet, for instance, is popping up all over the shop, always to dangerous effect. Deschamps is putting a lot of trust in his players talent and cunning. Thats how it should be.   8.29pm BST 27 min: After prolonged probing, France feed Pogba, who tries to blem a shot into the top corner from 25 yards. Never looked like coming off.   8.27pm BST 25 min: Rami turns playmaker, playing a splendid pass from half-way through to Giroud. A faster striker would have been in on goal, but speed is not among Girouds attributes, and Romania are able to make another last-ditch clearance.  Updated at 8.34pm BST  8.26pm BST 24 min: Sapunaru skins Evra with a lovely piece of skill, but Evra then barges him over. No foul, reckons the ref, whos evidently decided to allow forceful challenges, which is good.   8.24pm BST 22 min: Payet tries to send Griezmann through with a slick low ball from deep. Chiriches stretches out a leg and just manages to intercept. Thats the second time Payet has come close to releasing Griezmann, and you sense hell spring him successfully soon.   8.22pm BST 20 min: Popa tries to jink his way past Evra down the left and reassert Romanias attacking threat. But Evra shunts him out of the way and takes back the ball.   8.20pm BST 17 min: Kant is putting on quite a show: every time a Romanian gets the ball, Kant is on the scene immediately, like a cop whos been tipped off to a bank heist. Hes incredible.   8.17pm BST 15 min: Pogba rips Romania open with a superb pass from deep behind Rats. Sagna runs on to it and curls in a low cross towards Griezmann, who fails to apply a sure touch .. but the defender, taken by surprise, only spoons the ball up into the air, and Griezmann adjusts quickly to get to it and head towards goal from six yards .... but it bounces off the post and out!  Updated at 8.36pm BST  8.14pm BST 12 min: France are working up a head of steam now. Griezmann and Payet are getting plenty of the ball and looking inventive every time. Pogba is starting to come to the fore too, but his touch has been just a tad out so far.  Updated at 8.17pm BST  8.12pm BST 10 min: Corner to France after a 25-yard shot by Griezman gets deflected wide. Payet delivers but fails to beat the first man. But France regain it and knock it back to Payet on the left. After a flourish of trickery he sticks a nice cross up to Giroud at the near post. The striker had given his marker the slip but sends his header wide. Classic Giroud.  Updated at 8.42pm BST  8.11pm BST 8 min: Romania are spanking the ball about confidently when they get it, and with no little ambition. But not with quite enough alacrity on this occasion, as Stanciu had the ball nicked off him by a backtracking Griezmann.  Updated at 8.34pm BST  8.09pm BST 6 min: France have a bit of possession with which to settle themselves down. But Romania are working with diligence and dynamism to prevent the hosts from making inroads forward.  Updated at 8.33pm BST  8.07pm BST 4 min: Theres the French defensive vulnerability we were all talking about! Koscielny and Rami got in the muddle to concede a corner and then Frances setpiece failing were exposed by a near-post flick on from the corner. Lloris came to the rescue by making a wonderful save to deby Stancu, who tried to prod the ball into the net from three yards! The ensuing corner brings another chance for the visitors, Andone sending an arcing header onto the roof of the net.  Updated at 8.33pm BST  8.05pm BST 3 min: Rat attracts boos from the home crowd by taking his time with a throw-in. But he eventually flings it to a team-mate, who helps it on to Pintili. He draws Romania level on the all-important shots stats, whacking it way off target from 25 yards.   8.03pm BST 1 min: Cest parti! France show their attacking attentions by banging off a shot after 31 seconds. Matuidi didnt catch it properly but he can take encouragement from the fact that he was able find enough space in the Romanian box to hit an effort goalwards on the spin. Easy save for the keeper, though.   8.00pm BST Not all of the eyes of the footballing world are on Pairs, you know ... Keeper Rory Crowther joins the Lilywhites for 16/17 @WPL_Official season https://t.co/Iov3h7tqhz pic.twitter.com/y8ar9BzCHt  7.58pm BST Ah, La Marseillaise, the king of anthems, ironically enough. And what a rendition it gets here! All the French players and staff, and by the sounds of it everyone in Paris, belts it out like they want the whole world to hear it. Well done lads, now show us your football skills.   7.56pm BST Speaking of solemnity, here come the national anthems. Judging by the vocal accompaniment to the visitors one, there are plenty of Romanian fans in the Stade de France.  Updated at 8.02pm BST  7.55pm BST A fly-pass by French fighter plane, spewing colourful smoke to try to keep thing as light as fighter planes can, completes the opening ceremony. Chapeau for keeping it short, too.   7.54pm BST The appearance of David Guetta brings a tremendous roar from the crowd, and thats his cue to play a medley of poptastic ditties while the dancing continues. Theres no obvious theme to any of this, other than light entertainment, which is fine really: far too much solemnity in football these days, and maybe carefree lightness is exactly the tone to set amid all the heavier stuff going on before and around this tournament.   7.49pm BST Now a jaunty remix Edit Piafs La Vie en Rose is resounding around the stadium, while the cast assembled by Lewis Carroll continues to cavort around the pitch.  Updated at 7.53pm BST  7.47pm BST The Stade de France is decked out like a lavish French garden, albeit one with dancers dressed as candyfloss, daisies and lips. Oh, and theyre just been joined by another troupe to do the cancan. Feel free to join in at home.   7.44pm BST Im almost delirious with excitement looking forward to Wales first game tomorrow, dribbles Ianto. Could I ask English fans how its possible to get bored with this kind of thing? You havent been paying attention to recent tournament, have you?   7.42pm BST In Helsinki, the the locals are happily going about their business in the late evening sunshine, seemingly untroubled by Finlands umpteenth non-appearance in any sort of finals, hollers Charles Antaki. When I mention this in company, Im loudly reminded that they won the ice-hockey world cup the other year, thank you very much; and what exactly have England done recently? Fair comment. Now hold on, according to some of your compatriots in Marseille, England won a recent world war.   7.40pm BST Lee Dixon and Emmanuel Petit are talking to each other on ITV about the role of Koscielny as the leader of Frances defence. But Slaven Bilic wants to finish the point he was making first so deftly turns up the volume of his voice to teach the some respect. Authoritatively done. More authoritatively, indeed, than many of Koscielnys performances for France: hes a good player, for sure, but he is particularly rash when playing for his country and tends to give away a lot of oafish freekicks. And that can be costly, because France dont defend freekicks very well.   7.25pm BST Wonder what Vlad Chiriches has been up to since slinking out of Spurs? Heres the skinny. And here are short profiles of the entire Romania squad.  Updated at 7.30pm BST  7.22pm BST Between the fact that it will take a fortnight to reduce the teams from 24 to 16, and Englands selection policy being so skewed to to players from the richest clubs that its beginning to resemble the Oxbridge admissions policy, I find myself looking forward to this tournament less than any other in my lifetime, drones Shaun Wilkinson. Anything that you can think of that would cheer me up? Youre not being tear-gassed in Marseille, so thats something.   7.12pm BST Im fired up for this tournament! bugles Dan Schulwolf. The fact that the group stages in the Euros may be tedious, negative affairs contested by knackered players hasnt bothered me yet, despite the fact that many of the Copa America games have fit that stereotype of tournament play to a T. I guess for now, I dare to dream. Updated at 7.22pm BST  7.03pm BST In a tournament in which so little is predictable, there are still some persistent staples: news seeping in from Marseille is that some England fans are again fighting, breaking stuff and generally doing their utmost to bring everyone down. Some people just cant handle freedom.  Updated at 7.22pm BST  6.56pm BST France have named their team (below) and there are no surprises. Giroud starts at centre-forward with Payet and Greizmann either side of him. Martial and Coman will be introduced from the bench if France need a goal or feel like showing off. The inclusion of Kant in the place vacated by the injured Diarra, is the wisest move: not only will he protect a defence that needs it and try to shut down Romanias tricky schemer Nicolae Stanciu, but hell also give Pogba more freedom to go forward. Pogba hasnt been great for France recently so expecting him to impact this tournament the way Platini and Zidane did in the past may be too much: after all, hes only 23, Zidane had barely been capped at the same age and, whats more, he wasnt actually brilliant in the 98 World Cup even if he did head two goals in the final. But this France team may not need Pogba to be in top form: Payet and Greizmann can sparkle plenty.  5.56pm BST Hello and welcome: its showtime! After 266 qualifying matches, several weeks of rehearsals and a million selection squabbles, the 2016 European Championships is kicking off in Paris and it promises to be a lot of fun. The tournaments cast has never been so big and while expansion to 24 participants means watering down the quality, drama is still guaranteed. Theres no telling how things will pan out over the next month. If the stars are properly aligned by Roy Hodgson, even England have an earthly. A competition with no flawless team looks perfectly unpredictable. A handful of countries can realistically aspire to outright victory  including Poland and Austria  but four sides start with stronger credentials than the rest: the holders (Spain), the world champions (Germany), the highest-ranked team (Belgium) and the hosts, France, who get things under way this evening against Romania, who were unbeaten during the qualifiers and only conceded two goals. They even kept Kyle Lafferty quiet.  France, of course, won the last two major tournaments that they staged  the 1984 European Championships and the 1998 World Cup  and thats no easy feat, as evidenced by the fact that it has been nearly four decades since any other host won either competition (Argentina 78). But of course it was much more than home advantage that brought those victories to France: on both occasions Les Bleus had bloody good teams. Can we say the same about them now? Well thats what were here to find out. They sure have some exciting ingredients but theyre all in attack: their defence is vulnerable, although being able to field Laurent Koscielny and Adil Rami is actually an indication of Frances strength in depth in central defence: what other country would be able to pick a duo as decent as that after losing five players (Varane, Sakho, Laporte, Mathieu and Zouma) who would have been picked ahead of at least one of them? And looking at the calibre of attacking players that Deschamps has chosen to omit (Ben Arfa, Lacazette, Gameiro...) gives an indication of the awesome strike power that they he have called up: if Romans defence can stifle the likes of Greizmann, Payet, Pogba, Martial, Comon and potential golden boot winner Giroud, then they really are exceptional. Cant see it myself, mind. Then again, France know all too well what its like to be shocked in their opening match, thanks to Senegal.  Updated at 6.30pm BST  2.03pm BST France: Lloris; Sagna, Rami, Koscileny, Evra; Matuidi, Pogba, Kant; Payet, Giroud, Greizmann Romania: Ttruanu; Spunaru, Grigore, Chiriche, Ra; Hoban, Pintilii; Stanciu, Popa, Stancu; Andone Referee: Viktor Kassai (Hun) For Barney Ronays take on tonights opening game, click here.

With the stingiest defence in qualification  Romania conceded only two goals in their 10 matches  it is clear where Romanias strengths lie, and Anghel Iordanescu will again attempt to make the most of a core of underrated, hard-working and hungry players in a disciplined 4-2-3-1 system.  Related: Euro 2016: the complete guide to every squad and every player in France  Fiorentinas Ciprian Tatarusanu is settled as the first-choice goalkeeper but Iordanescus biggest defensive headache is finding a suitable right-back. Paul Papp was first choice in qualifying but has been in woeful form at Steaua Bucharest, where he has been frequently dropped, and did not make the squad. Panduriis Cristian Sapunaru, formerly of Porto, or Dinamo Zagrebs Alexandru Matel will fight for the place Papp has vacated. At left-back is Iordanescus captain, Razvan Rat, who has recently returned from shoulder surgery. Vlad Chiriches, now at Napoli after an ill-fated spell at Tottenham, and Dragos Grigore are the favourites to occupy the centre-back positions with Ludogorets Cosmin Moti and Valerica Gaman of Astra Giurgiu providing back-up. Chiriches has crammed a lot of experience into his 26 years and is arguably Iordanescus most valuable player, but his performances this season have featured simple mistakes at critical moments and a tendency to lose his head when one-on-one. Screening the back four from defensive midfield will be Ovidiu Hoban of Hapoel Beer Sheva and Steauas Mihai Pintilii. Both are disciplined and impressive at breaking up the play but offer little in the way of attacking threat. And that is Iordanescus greatest quandary. For all that Romania are reliable in defence and effective on the counterattack, the question remains what the manager will do should his side find themselves behind. As demonstrated in qualification, without a plan B the attacking burden rests heavy on the front four. Competing for the sole striker position is Denis Alibec  the standout centre-forward in Romania this season  Florin Andone, who has been shining at Crdoba in Spain, and Claudiu Keseru, currently plying his trade at Ludogorets. All three are in great form but Iordanescu has criticised Alibec, once of Internazionale, for being overweight and Andones form in Spains Segunda Divisin  where he was the joint top scorer  could see him steal the spot. But it is the makeup of the three-man line behind the centre-forward that Iordanescu must get right. On the right Steauas Adrian Popa and Gabriel Torje  on loan at Osmanlispor from Udinese  are two speedy wingers and they will compete for a place in the side while on the left Bogdan Stancu is likely to start. Stancu has performed well for Genclerbirligi this season, was key for Romania in qualification and his long-range shooting is a dangerous weapon, even if he can go missing for large spells of matches. And in the middle Iordanescu must chose between young and old. Nicolae Stanciu, 23, has announced himself as Steauas new star this season, dazzling in the No10 role with his dribbling, excellent passing and dangerous free-kicks. He was also excellent in Romanias goalless draw with Spain in March. Or there is the 35-year-old Lucian Sanmartean, currently seeing out the twilight of his career with Al Ittihad in Saudi Arabia but a wizard of a player nonetheless. Which Romania player is going to surprise everyone at Euro 2016? Florin Andone plays in Spains second tier with Crdoba but has the capacity to trouble high-profile opposition. Smart, quick, strong and willing to fight for his goals  he scored 21 of them in 36 league games for his club this season  Andone will be Romanias main goalscoring hope at Euro 2016. Which player could be a disappointment? Razvan Rat had a complicated season at Rayo, which ended with relegation to the Spanish second division. The 35-year-old played only 14 minutes for his club since early November because of shoulder surgery, but his status as national team captain ensured he was called up to the squad that will travel to France. If fully fit, he is certain to start at left-back. What is the realistic aim for Romania at Euro 2016 and why? If the manager and his players survive a difficult opening game against France with their optimism and self-esteem intact, Romania can reach the knock-out stage. The team hopes that its reactive, compact style of football will be a competitive alternative to what previous generations have shown on the international stage. In the likes of Andone, Chiriches and Stanciu, they have players with the hunger to make it happen  even in an era when Romanian football has no geniuses.  Catalin Andrei writes for sport.ro.

Related: Bill Beaumont takes World Rugby reins with global calendar in his sights  The move enhances the prospects of Georgia and Romania joining the Six Nations, a move that the Rugby Football Union  looking for a new chairman to replace the departing Beaumont  has opposed, along with the other five members. Lapassets parting gift as chairman makes it harder to keep the door closed. Beaumont and Lapasset traded compliments at the Dublin media call to announce the former England captains new role, but when Lapasset secured a second term at Beaumonts expense in 2011, winning a vote that had to be postponed because of rising tensions in the two camps, he wasted no time in activating his mandate for change based on giving second-tier nations a voice and widening the games base. The landscape has changed for Beaumont who as well as having to deal with the demands for recognition from emerging countries like Georgia and Romania has to preside over the increasingly fractious debate over the international calendar from 2020. Part of the reason for the current impasse in the attempts to help reduce the load on top players is the refusal of the Six Nations committee to consider shifting the championship from its February start. The sport is in excellent health and over the next four years there will be many more opportunities to grow the game, Beaumont said. When it comes to the international calendar debate, it is about reaching compromises. You might get a situation like in a business deal, where you actually shake hands on something youre both slightly disappointed with and would like to get a bit more. That could be the case with the calendar. Beaumonts vice-chairman will be the former Argentina scrum-half Agustn Pichot, the first time someone from outside the eight foundation unions has held the position. Argentina, along with Italy, will see their votes on the council increase from one to two, in line with the eight, while Georgia, Romania and the United States will join Canada, Japan and the six regional unions in having one vote, vastly increasing their standing in the game. They will, for example, have a say in who hosts World Cups. This shows the model and pathway are in place for other unions who aspire to have a seat on the council, Lapasset said. We encourage them all to take inspiration from Georgia, Romania and the USA to review their governance and strive to reach the required criteria. World Rugby is committed to the sustainable growth of the sport set against a backdrop of transparency, integrity and strong governance. The foundation unions no longer have an in-built majority on the council, with 16 of the 33 votes (the chairman and vice-chairman, however, have one reach). Pichot vowed to continue Lapassets work in encouraging second-tier nations to improve the way they operate so they are able to gain a seat and voting rights, and he is likely to complement the more diplomatic Beaumont by being opinionated and direct. Beaumont, meanwhile, said he did not rule out the Six Nations expanding in the future to include Georgia and Romania, adding that he did not see promotion and relegation as an option. That opinion is shared by the president of Rugby Europe, Octavian Morariu, a former Romania international. Enlargement is a more practical option than promotion and relegation which would reduce stability, Morariu said. We must be careful not to damage the Six Nations, which is a commercial company, and talks are taking place to include Georgia and Romania in the Under-20 Six Nations, something that may happen in three years. The priority for us now is for Georgia and Romania to have more fixtures against tier one nations, which is where the global calendar debate comes in. They must be given fixtures if they are to progress. Meanwhile World Rugby has changed the seeding system for the 2019 World Cup after last years tournament drew a pool that included England, Australia and Wales. There will still be five bands of seeds in each group based on the world rankings, but the cut-off point will be May next year rather than this December giving European teams the chance to improve their standings in the Six Nations as opposed to November Tests against the major southern hemisphere countries."

Even more so if you are in communist Romania in the 1980s, where news is state-controlled and everyday items rationed. And yet, between 1982 and 1988 almost a dozen churches, as well as other buildings, were moved hundreds of metres in order to save them from destruction, as dictator Nicolae Ceauescu went about radically redesigning the heart of Bucharest, the Romanian capital. That a communist country would go out of its way to save churches is strange enough, but the method of saving them, when other countries would probably have tried to dismantle the buildings and reassemble them elsewhere, makes the achievement all the more impressive. We were awestruck at those operations, comparing them with the landing on the moon for a country like Romania, says Valentin Mandache, an architectural historian who witnessed the moving of several of the churches when he was still a young student. At the centre of it all was Eugeniu Iordchescu, a civil engineer who had the radical idea to place whole buildings on the equivalent of railway tracks and roll them to safety. I was in the area that was to be knocked down and I saw a beautiful small church and started wondering how it was possible to demolish such a jewel, says the sprightly 87-year-old, sitting in his dining room in a nondescript apartment in Bucharest, a few miles from where the churches he saved three decades ago still stand. I thought about the idea of moving it. At that time 30,000 residents were being forced from their homes, with an entire district of historical Bucharest, roughly 9,000 houses as well as churches, synagogues and other buildings demolished to make way for Ceauescus grandiose vanity project, the Palace of the People and surrounding civic centre. The remodelled city centre and palace  which still dominates the skyline and is said to be the second largest administrative building in the world after the Pentagon  were supposedly inspired by Ceauescus visit to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. Iordchescu, who worked at engineering and design centre the Project Institute in Bucharest, says that when he first broached the subject of moving the church with his colleagues he was told that it wasnt possible, that the building would fall over. Some thought he was crazy for even suggesting it, but slowly the idea formed in his head. The engineer says he reached the breakthrough after seeing a waiter pass through a crowd of people with a tray of glasses in his hand. I saw that the secret of the glasses not falling was the tray, so I started trying to work out how to apply a tray to the building. Ultimately a process was developed whereby the ground was dug out from under the churches, with a large reinforced concrete support created and the foundations severed. Tracks were laid, and hydraulic levers and industrial pulleys were used to slowly move the buildings to their new locations, often at a few metres an hour. Iordchescu moved entire apartment buildings with the water and gas lines still attached, and people still inside them One church would require a team of around five engineers for the planning phases, and then upwards of 20 workers when the physical work was under way. They had to rely exclusively on local equipment and technologies, since communist Romania was largely cut off from the outside world. Tracks and other equipment were reused from site to site to save on costs and materials. Meanwhile, the route from one site to the other had to be cleared and the logistics of the move planned, including issues of gradients and rotating the buildings. Many were sceptical that it would work, and for the first church they were only given verbal permission to go ahead, with no one wanting to sign the written approval.  The first church to be moved, the 18th-century Schitul Maicilor, weighing 745 tonnes, was relocated 245 metres away from its original site in 1982. The whole project took five months  though the actual process of moving the structures would often take just a few days. Priests, government officials and locals would often gather to watch the final spectacle; in some photographs Iordchescu is seen standing alongside the patriarch of the Romanian Orthodox Church. As time went on the team got more and more ambitious, with the 16th-century Mihai Voda Church being moved in tandem with its standalone tower. The largest church that was moved, technically a monastery, weighed 9,000 tonnes. It was shifted 24 metres from its original location. In Bucharest and other cities, Iordchescu and his colleagues moved a hospital and a bank  and even entire apartment buildings, often with the water and gas lines still attached and the people still inside them. One building, people inside thought the move would start at 9am so they prepared their luggage, with their papers, valuables, but we started at 6am, so at 9am when they went to leave it had already moved a couple of metres, says Iordchescu, showing me an old photograph of himself standing on the balcony of a moving building. Despite the complexity of the work, all of the buildings made it unscathed to their final locations. However, it wasnt all good news. Iordchescu has a list of 22 churches that were destroyed in the period, some having already been given permission to be moved, with Ceauescu impatient to get on with the urban overhaul of the capital. Pointing to an image of a church, once located in what is now Piaa Unirii  a huge brash square thats effectively a roundabout a few hundred metres from the Palace of the People  Iordchescus son Adrian, also a civil engineer, says: It was a tragedy. The priest died of a heart attack. Even the workers didnt want to demolish it, so Ceauescu got people from prison to do it. Adrian, 54, has continued his fathers legacy, using an updated version of the technology to recently retrofit the citys Arcul de Triumf monument. Many of the moved churches, though, ended up being relocated in the shadows of large, soviet-style apartment blocks, often sandwiched tightly as if daring those who pass by to blink and miss them. Visitors to the city can find Schitul Maicilor hidden behind a huge building that contains several government ministries. Yet, preserving these important churches in the capital, along with their hundreds of years of history, ornate interiors and elaborate iconography and paintings, has had an important cultural legacy.   Related: How nature turned a failed communist plan into Bucharest's unique urban park  It is amazing what they were able to achieve, says Adrian, adding: During the moves all the day he was on site, because at the very beginning he heard people from the working team would try to sabotage it, so he would stay 24 hours a day. Highlighting Antim Monastery, one of the saved buildings, Mandache points to the importance of what was achieved in saving those buildings three decades ago. Antim is a jewel of Brancovan-style architecture. Architecture is the most visible identity marker of a community, and those churches are among the most important such markers, he adds. The relocation of churches and other buildings stopped with the Romanian revolution in 1989, and in the years since Iordchescu has received a number of honorary diplomas for his work, as well as a medal from the Romanian Orthodox church. He only fully retired a few years ago. Yet, as the years go by his achievements have become more and more clouded in the fog of time. Im 54, the younger generation of architects dont know the method, says Adrian Iordchescu. My son is 23 and a student at the architectural university. Hes only really discovering what his grandfather did in the last year or so. Still, Iordchescu is very proud of what he and his colleagues did. When I see the churches today I still cant believe it, he says. Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook and join the discussion"

Sebastian, who was born Iosif Mendel Hechter in Br<c3><83><e2><80><9e><c3><82><c6><92>ila, a port on the Danube, in 1907, was a rising star in Romanian culture when <em>For Two Thousand Years</em> (<em>De dou<c3><83><e2><80><9e><c3><82><c6><92> mii de ani</em>) was published in 1934. He was a respected lawyer, a successful dramatist and a literary critic and commentator on the arts.

Not related to Eugen, Nae Ionescu was a philosopher with an interest in politics and economics. The younger man was so in awe of him that he was often tongue-tied in his presence. Even though Nae had begun to express antisemitic opinions, Sebastian gave him the typescript of <em>For Two Thousand Years</em> to read and asked him to write a foreword. Ionescu duly obliged with a venomous diatribe in which he chastised the author he had once praised and encouraged for daring to assert that a Jew could belong to any national community: <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><c5><93>It is an assimilationist illusion, it is the illusion of so many Jews who sincerely believe that they are Romanian <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><c2><a6> Remember that you are Jewish!

He was soon to regret his rash decision. Leftwing critics, who included self-proclaimed Zionists, accused him of being antisemitic himself, while those of the infinitely larger rightwing persuasion echoed Ionescu<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>s sentiments.

The book received enormous coverage in the media and Sebastian was suddenly famous, in a way that he never really had been in life. This gentle, cultivated and good humoured man, with his passionate love of classical music, was the subject of widespread controversy. A new generation of conservative critics voiced opinions not entirely dissimilar to Nae Ionescu<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>s, asserting that Sebastian<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>s problems were entirely Jewish, with the long dormant phrase <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><c5><93>Jewish problem<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><c2><9d> being resurrected in several reviews.

In one particularly vivid entry in <em>Journal</em>, he records how the actress Marietta Sadova <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> always happy to take leading parts in his plays <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> was <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><c5><93>choking with antisemitism<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><c2><9d>.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image element--supporting"" data-media-id=""d866c7c91a90b7cbfc22ff2262c10b9a4fa05a49""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/d866c7c91a90b7cbfc22ff2262c10b9a4fa05a49/0_0_405_591/343.jpg"" alt=""Mihail Sebastian."" width=""343"" height=""500"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Mihail Sebastian.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet it was the distinguished academic Petru Cretia who spoke for the majority of readers when he observed, in 1997, that Sebastian was not besmirching lofty national values with his <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><c5><93>calm, sad and forgiving revelations<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><c2><9d>.

Both the novel and the diary are disconcerting because their overall tone is so reasonable, so painstakingly on the side of common sense and simple human decency.

In the early chapters, he is a vivid and slightly exasperating presence, whose every word is recorded in a notebook by his devoted follower. It is Blidaru who advises him to study architecture, which he does, becoming an apprentice under, and assistant to, Mircea Vieru, known as the <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><c5><93>master<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><c2><9d>, a modernist of genius, as Sebastian persuades the reader to believe. In this unashamed novel of ideas, it is those of Vieru that are the most palatable to the liberal and liberated conscience of the west. The sentimental and condescending notion of the saintliness of the Romanian peasant (still doing the rounds today) holds no appeal to him as it did, astonishingly, to Nae Ionescu, Eliade and Cioran, when they mistook fanaticism for reason.</p> <p>The tone sustained throughout the novel is one of dismayed affection, as in the scene where he pays homage to Abraham Sulitzer, <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><c5><93>my old Ahasverus<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><c2><9d>, the wandering bookseller who insists that Yiddish will remain a living language. He shows the disbelieving youngster Yiddish translations of Shakespeare, Cervantes, Dostoevsky and Hardy, while his silent wife Roza looks on. Roza is accustomed to this, for when Abraham doesn<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>t have a visitor or a customer he talks to his books rather than to her. It is such a felicitous literary conceit that it has to be true. Abraham is disapproving of assimilation, as is Sami Winkler, with whom the narrator has conversations that the two men realise can<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>t end in agreement, but are amicable nonetheless. Sami leaves Nazi Romania for Palestine. The ardent Marxist, ST Haim, an attractive Francophile, is slung into prison for his subversive views.

Sebastian, who was born Iosif Mendel Hechter in Brila, a port on the Danube, in 1907, was a rising star in Romanian culture when For Two Thousand Years (De dou mii de ani) was published in 1934. He was a respected lawyer, a successful dramatist and a literary critic and commentator on the arts. He had friends who would be famous in middle age: Mircea Eliade, the expert on the subtle differences between the worlds religions; EM Cioran, the maverick philosopher who moved to Paris and became one of the great prose stylists in the French language, and Eugen Ionescu, the future absurdist playwright who Gallicised his first name to Eugne and changed the u at the end of his second to an o once he, too, had established himself as a Parisian. Sebastians mentor, the man he admired above all others, was also called Ionescu. Not related to Eugen, Nae Ionescu was a philosopher with an interest in politics and economics. The younger man was so in awe of him that he was often tongue-tied in his presence. Even though Nae had begun to express antisemitic opinions, Sebastian gave him the typescript of For Two Thousand Years to read and asked him to write a foreword. Ionescu duly obliged with a venomous diatribe in which he chastised the author he had once praised and encouraged for daring to assert that a Jew could belong to any national community: It is an assimilationist illusion, it is the illusion of so many Jews who sincerely believe that they are Romanian  Remember that you are Jewish! Are you Iosif Hechter, a human being from Brila on the Danube? No, you are a Jew from Brila on the Danube. After some reflection, Sebastian told his publisher to go ahead and print, word for hateful word, what Ionescu had written. He was soon to regret his rash decision. Leftwing critics, who included self-proclaimed Zionists, accused him of being antisemitic himself, while those of the infinitely larger rightwing persuasion echoed Ionescus sentiments. The Jews, they contested, were responsible for all the ills besetting their beloved country  communism, syphilis and homosexuality being among the most prevalent. In 1935, the wilfully misunderstood writer rose to his own defence in the essay How I Became a Hooligan (Cum am devenit huligan). It must have occurred to him, before that low, dishonest decade reached its end, that he had been fighting a battle that was already lost. It is thanks to his brother Benu, who secreted the unpublished journal in the diplomatic pouch of the Israeli embassy in Bucharest when he emigrated from Romania to Israel in 1961, that Mihail Sebastian is now regarded as one of the foremost chroniclers of the rise of nazism in civilised Europe. The manuscript remained in the Hechter familys possession until they thought it safe to send a copy to a reputable publishing house in Romania. Journal 1935-1944 finally appeared in 1996, after the secret police had been disbanded. The book received enormous coverage in the media and Sebastian was suddenly famous, in a way that he never really had been in life. This gentle, cultivated and good humoured man, with his passionate love of classical music, was the subject of widespread controversy. A new generation of conservative critics voiced opinions not entirely dissimilar to Nae Ionescus, asserting that Sebastians problems were entirely Jewish, with the long dormant phrase Jewish problem being resurrected in several reviews. The truth is that Sebastians problems were of the everyday kind before his friends saw fit to remind him that, for all his cleverness, he was essentially an outcast. In one particularly vivid entry in Journal, he records how the actress Marietta Sadova  always happy to take leading parts in his plays  was choking with antisemitism. Yet it was the distinguished academic Petru Cretia who spoke for the majority of readers when he observed, in 1997, that Sebastian was not besmirching lofty national values with his calm, sad and forgiving revelations. He went on to describe Sebastian as a fair-minded (often angelic) witness. That gets it right. Both the novel and the diary are disconcerting because their overall tone is so reasonable, so painstakingly on the side of common sense and simple human decency. Both the anonymous narrator in the one and the beleaguered diarist in the other remain hopeful when hopelessness and numb despair seem like the only options. For Two Thousand Years has been available in French for a long time, but Philip  Ceallaighs excellent translation marks its first appearance in English. It opens in 1923, when Romanian Jews were, rather begrudgingly, granted equality with their Gentile compatriots. The new law makes the unnamed teenage narrator aware of his Jewishness, having given the fact little consideration up till then. He does not want to be a fellow sufferer or martyr, unlike another pupil Marcel Winder, who almost relishes the beatings he endures. He prefers to be alone and making his own choices. Theres a telling aside in which he notes: Id like to be an antisemite for five minutes. To feel an enemy in myself who must be vanquished. Perhaps that very thought had come to the 16-year-old Iosif Hechter in his early struggles to make sense of the inexplicable. The character of Ghi Blidaru, the brilliant lecturer and theorist who exerts his influence on the impressionable young student, is said to be based on Nae Ionescu. It is not an unflattering portrait of a complicated individual who would go on to accept money from IG Farben for his pro-Nazi activities. In the early chapters, he is a vivid and slightly exasperating presence, whose every word is recorded in a notebook by his devoted follower. It is Blidaru who advises him to study architecture, which he does, becoming an apprentice under, and assistant to, Mircea Vieru, known as the master, a modernist of genius, as Sebastian persuades the reader to believe. In this unashamed novel of ideas, it is those of Vieru that are the most palatable to the liberal and liberated conscience of the west. The sentimental and condescending notion of the saintliness of the Romanian peasant (still doing the rounds today) holds no appeal to him as it did, astonishingly, to Nae Ionescu, Eliade and Cioran, when they mistook fanaticism for reason. The tone sustained throughout the novel is one of dismayed affection, as in the scene where he pays homage to Abraham Sulitzer, my old Ahasverus, the wandering bookseller who insists that Yiddish will remain a living language. He shows the disbelieving youngster Yiddish translations of Shakespeare, Cervantes, Dostoevsky and Hardy, while his silent wife Roza looks on. Roza is accustomed to this, for when Abraham doesnt have a visitor or a customer he talks to his books rather than to her. It is such a felicitous literary conceit that it has to be true. Abraham is disapproving of assimilation, as is Sami Winkler, with whom the narrator has conversations that the two men realise cant end in agreement, but are amicable nonetheless. Sami leaves Nazi Romania for Palestine. The ardent Marxist, ST Haim, an attractive Francophile, is slung into prison for his subversive views. Sebastian gives breathing space to them all, as he does for Maurice Buret, the soi-disant panderer he befriends in Paris, who might have been imagined by Choderlos de Laclos, and Marin Dronu, the determined womaniser and heavy drinker with whom he forms a cautious relationship. Each one is afforded a voice, an idiosyncratic way of speaking, that makes them instantly  and, in some cases, memorably  recognisable. The narrator remains hopeful when numb despair seems like the only option Sebastian is a novelist who listens to what his people wish to tell him, especially when he disapproves of everything they are saying. He understands, as a man of the theatre, that a conversation can be more revealing than mere exposition allows. For Two Thousand Years is crammed with conversations, with arguments, with outright speechifying. His narrative method, which is not linear by any means, reflects exactly the voluble and volatile society that inspires it. I preserve an old sense of obligation, an inevitable sympathy, for the isolated or beaten individual. The only pain which I understand directly and instinctively, without needing it explained, is the pain of discouragement. On hearing of Nae Ionescus death in March 1940, at the age of 49, Sebastian wept for the man he had once revered. A life that should have encompassed lasting intellectual distinction had fizzled out in defeat and failure. He was denied the opportunity of apologising, with hindsight, for the sheer banality of his political opinions, though it remains doubtful that he would ever have done so. Eugne Ionesco, who loved and respected Sebastian, hated his namesake for creating a stupid and reactionary Romania. Cioran admitted that he had been wrong in his youth, but Eliade could only allow himself to remark that communism won. A lesser human being would have skewered these monsters in his writings, but Sebastian is of an altogether higher order. They are not satirised in For Two Thousand Years, nor are they misrepresented in the scrupulously accurate entries in Journal 1935-1944. I will never cease to be a Jew, of course, Sebastian has his architect say at the close of the novel. This is not a position I can resign from. Its not a matter of pride or shame. These are the sentiments that caused offence to the Zionists in 1934, but they could have been expressed by Primo Levi and Giorgio Bassani when Mussolini gave approval to the racial laws that were introduced in 1938. Two years earlier, in benighted Bucharest, Sebastian had his journalists travel pass confiscated and his work as a lawyer dwindled away. Although he was never deported, he spent the rest of his short, splendid life as an exile in the city he had once adorned.

Why should it be acceptable, never mind that it used to be, to insult, denigrate and stigmatise various groups and minorities in society?</p> <p>It was at one time regarded as acceptable for a player to throw a punch on the rugby field, and worse, but what coach would advocate that behaviour now? Times change, sometimes for the better.</p> <p>Marler was cited, belatedly, for elbowing his Wales opposite number, Rob Evans, in the face 15 minutes into the game (the pre-match build-up had seen both sides accuse the other of illegal scrummaging and saw two props cited and another sent to the sin-bin).</p> <p>He was found guilty of the offence at a disciplinary hearing in London on Wednesday but was not suspended as the panel did not regard the elbowing as an offence worthy of a red card. That was a fair decision, but the day before the Wales prop Tomas Francis had received an eight-week ban for putting his hand on the face of his opposite number, Dan Cole.</p> <p>That offence was reviewed by the referee and the television match official, as had been the case in January when Chris Ashton<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>s England recall was ended by his citing for putting his hand hear the eyes of an opponent during Saracens<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2> European Champions Cup victory over Ulster at Allianz Park. No action was taken against either player, apart from a penalty.</p> <p>Numerous disciplinary panels have, in imposing deterrent bans, ruled a hand near an opponent<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>s eyes is a red card offence and surely it is now time for referees to act on that. It is not a question of intent or injury caused, but a bid to get players to go lower to minimise the risk of a serious eye injury.</p> <h2>Pocock to take a break</h2> <p>The Australia back-rower David Pocock has signed a new contract with the Australian Rugby Union that will take him through to the 2019 World Cup, but he will have a year off in 2017.</p> <p>Pocock has been linked to a move to a club in England, France or Japan, but he is more interested in studying and freshening up rather than giving his body another battering.</p> <p><c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><c5><93>This is my 11th season of professional rugby and I really want to continue, but I feel like a bit of a break will be good for the mind, good for the body and probably good for the soul too,<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><c2><9d> he said. <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><c5><93>A bunch of things have been said about what I will be doing, but none that I have heard are true.</p> <p><c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><c5><93>We will wait and see.

England are on the trail of the elusive grand slam in Paris while 2,000 thousand miles away in Tbilisi, Georgia will be looking for a clean sweep in the European Nations Cup. The Central Stadium in the Georgia capital holds nearly 55,000 spectators and is expected to be close to capacity for the visit of Romania in a clash between not just the leading two teams in the tournament, but countries who look to have outgrown it with nowhere else to go. The Wales head coach, Warren Gatland, this week asked the question whether, in the coming years, the Six Nations should consider having a play-off between the team that finishes bottom and the champions of the Nations Cup, with the winner competing in the main event. Gatland was speaking a few days before Waless match against Italy, who have already secured their 11th wooden spoon in 17 tournaments since they swelled the Five Nations to six in 2000. His timing may have been unfortunate, although he qualified his remarks by saying they were not a comment on the Azzurri but a contribution to a debate on how the international game in Europe should be developed. We and Romania need to be given a chance, something to aspire to, and we have been saying this for a while, said Lasha Khurtsidze, the Georgian Rugby Union general secretary. Argentina were in our position not that long ago and look at them now since they were brought into the Rugby Championship. I think Gatlands suggestion is definitely the way to go, but we need regular contact with Tier One nations first. We have played Ireland in 2014 and we have a fixture with Scotland. There might be something in 2017 and 2018, we dont know, but the game gains nothing if countries like Georgia and Romania are only exposed to major opposition during World Cups and are largely left to their own devices in between tournaments. We are ambitious and we need to have an outlet for that. Since the European Nations Cup was changed to its current format in 2000, Georgia and Romania have vied for the title, apart from 12 years ago when Portugal were the champions. Unlike the Six Nations, the Nations Cup has relegation and promotion and bonus points, a system exploited by both Georgia and Romania who both showed during last years World Cup that they have shed their reputations for being strong at forward but not having much idea of what to do with the ball. Under Bernard Lapassets chairmanship, World Rugby has done a lot for second tier countries, said Khurtsidze. We have regular contact with the likes of Fiji, Japan and Canada, but breaking into the Six Nations is something else. I do not know if they are afraid at upsetting the old order, but the World Cup has opened up the game. Unless they want that tournament to be contested by 10 teams, they need to give others the chance to grow. We have not been able to speak to the Six Nations. With the help of World Rugby, we want to sit round a table with them and discuss the future. They might tell us that there is no prospect of Georgia and Romania having a chance of being part of the championship, in which case we would need to find alternatives. We are not going to stand still: rugby is developing. Our domestic league system is expanding and we have enjoyed success at Under-20 level. Georgians are passionate about the game, as people will see on Saturday. The showdown in Tbilisi will be streamed live, and free of charge, on RugbyEurope.tv. Georgia have already qualified for the 2019 World Cup having finished third in their pool in last years tournament, but Romania missed out after losing 32-22 to Italy at Exeters Sandy Park in their final group match. Our dream is to have a chance of playing in the Six Nations, said Romanias team manager, Horatiu Bargaunas. We and Georgia proved during the World Cup that we play a good level of rugby and it is about being exposed to the next stage up. We cannot get fixtures against Tier One nations outside World Cups and did not have one between the 2011 and 2015 tournaments. We went into last years World Cup with France and Ireland our first two opponents and it was a big step up for us. We welcome Warren Gatlands comments because it keeps the debate going. The Six Nations opened the door to Italy in 2000 and when Romania were doing well in the 1980s there was talk about us joining. We fell off a bit and it did not happen, but our game is growing again and good young players are coming through the system. We just want to have something to aim for. World Rugbys investment in Tier Two nations has allowed Georgia and Romania to bring in experienced foreign coaches: the former New Zealand Under-21 coach Milton Haig has been in charge of the Lelos since 2011, while Lynn Howells, who was a member of Graham Henrys Wales management team, has managed Romania since 2012 and has another two years on his contract. Lynn has had a big impact with us, said Bargaunas. He has used his experience to build on what Romania was good at, forward play, not change everything. We are now far better behind and we hope that he stays on, making sure that we qualify for the 2019 World Cup. These are important years for Romanian rugby. The Georgia Rugby Union is hoping for a sell-out on Saturday. More than 15,000 tickets had been sold by the start of the week, but Khurtsidze pointed out that rugby fans there tend to turn up on the day rather than buy in advance. The match may attract a bigger crowd than Dublins Aviva Stadium for the match between Ireland and Scotland and drop a hint to the Six Nations that it is facing a spring rising. England enter the final round of the Six Nations with their sixth chance of finishing with a victory that would seal the grand slam, and once again they are on the road, even if Paris is a new destination. They have played for the prize in Edinburgh, Dublin (three times) and Cardiff, succeeding once, against Ireland in 2003, the year they went on to win the World Cup by defeating Eddie Joness Australia in the final. And in 1999, the last year of the Five Nations, they were mugged by Wales at Wembley. Unlike 2011 and 2013, matches a number of the current squad including Dylan Hartley, Dan Cole, Ben Youngs and James Haskell were involved in, England have already secured the title: there will be no repeat of Dublin five years ago when England, after losing, had to wait until later that night before being confirmed as champions and went through a hurried presentation ceremony that was low on smiles. What remains the same is that failure to secure the grand slam will secure more attention than winning the title, although much has been made in the past four years of England failing to finish higher, or lower, than second. Frances continued underwhelming form will see to that, although they stirred themselves in 2014 when Ireland came to the Stade de France needing to win to secure the championship and only just made it to the line. Eddie Jones has already succeeded, less than four months after taking over from Stuart Lancaster and starting from the ruin of the World Cup campaign. A question players are being asked this week is the difference he has made given that he is largely working with the group of players he inherited. One clue was a remark he made on Sunday night after Frances defeat to Scotland at Murrayfield meant England could not be overhauled at the top of the table. He would, he said, be taking the players out for a few beers to mark the occasion. It reflected his entry point, a team that had played badly rather than, in the case of Lancaster four years before, played up. The antics of the England players in New Zealand during the 2011 World Cup meant that the new regime had to preach the virtues of temperance. The squad had a reputation to salvage and it was not the time to talk about going out for a beer or two. Jones has developed a reputation for being a martinet, a workaholic who pushes his charges, together with his coaches and back-up team, to the limit. It ignores his ability to separate work and relaxation: when players have down-time, he does not want them to spend it in the gym, keeping minds, as well as bodies, fresh; tune in, zone out. Jones played in the amateur era and while recognising, as he showed when reprimanding the prop Joe Marler for his insulting comment to the Wales prop Samson Lee, that the law of the jungle that operated then is no longer appropriate, he also appreciates that some of the values that once stood, not least the way players who are drawn from a number of clubs bond, are still relevant. His former club Saracens have long recognised that and their No8 Billy Vunipola remarked after the World Cup that perhaps the players should have gone to the pub occasionally to get to know each other better away from their training base. Vunipola said this week that he had only just got to know Haskell and that the squad has a closeness that it lacked before. If England do become rattled on Saturday, it will be down to France, not the occasion. If the pressure got to players in 2011 and 2013, it is far less likely to do so this week because of the way Jones has approached the game, drawing on his experience. Warren Gatland made a surprising slip this week when he described Joe Marlers Gypsy boy remark to Samson Lee as banter. The Wales head coach is normally sure-footed with the media, and while he was trying to support his player, who wanted the apology he received from Marler at half-time at Twickenham to mark the end of the affair, he harked back to a time when television programmes like Love Thy Neighbour passed for humour. The reaction to Marlers words, never mind that they were spoken in the heat of the battle, did not amount to political correctness gone mad. Why should it be acceptable, never mind that it used to be, to insult, denigrate and stigmatise various groups and minorities in society? It was at one time regarded as acceptable for a player to throw a punch on the rugby field, and worse, but what coach would advocate that behaviour now? Times change, sometimes for the better. Marler was cited, belatedly, for elbowing his Wales opposite number, Rob Evans, in the face 15 minutes into the game (the pre-match build-up had seen both sides accuse the other of illegal scrummaging and saw two props cited and another sent to the sin-bin). He was found guilty of the offence at a disciplinary hearing in London on Wednesday but was not suspended as the panel did not regard the elbowing as an offence worthy of a red card. That was a fair decision, but the day before the Wales prop Tomas Francis had received an eight-week ban for putting his hand on the face of his opposite number, Dan Cole. That offence was reviewed by the referee and the television match official, as had been the case in January when Chris Ashtons England recall was ended by his citing for putting his hand hear the eyes of an opponent during Saracens European Champions Cup victory over Ulster at Allianz Park. No action was taken against either player, apart from a penalty. Numerous disciplinary panels have, in imposing deterrent bans, ruled a hand near an opponents eyes is a red card offence and surely it is now time for referees to act on that. It is not a question of intent or injury caused, but a bid to get players to go lower to minimise the risk of a serious eye injury. The Australia back-rower David Pocock has signed a new contract with the Australian Rugby Union that will take him through to the 2019 World Cup, but he will have a year off in 2017. Pocock has been linked to a move to a club in England, France or Japan, but he is more interested in studying and freshening up rather than giving his body another battering. This is my 11th season of professional rugby and I really want to continue, but I feel like a bit of a break will be good for the mind, good for the body and probably good for the soul too, he said. A bunch of things have been said about what I will be doing, but none that I have heard are true. We will wait and see. The exciting thing will be just getting away, freshening up and really coming back excited and, I hope, physically and mentally good to go. Billy Vunipola is happy to lead from the front, he tells Robert Kitson. US professional rugby a step closer as five teams begin training for kick-off, writes Martin Pengelly. Eddie Jones now knows how much a grand slam would mean to England, reckons Robert Kitson. Look back on last weekends Six Nations action with our talking points from the fourth round of matches.

Eliade may be describing the life of a student in a Romanian lyce of almost a century ago, but anyone who has ever been at school, full of ideals but also too shy to speak to the opposite sex, or incapable of revising for an exam until the very last minute, will relate to this. As will anyone who has ever committed their private thoughts to paper, as the true record of their soul and a rebuke to posterity. My Diary flatters me, satisfies my longing for revenge; just revenge on those who misunderstand me. The joke behind Adrian Mole and, indeed, most fictional diaries, is that intrying to seem wiser and more grown-up, the narrator inadvertently reveals truths that are withheld from his or her own scrutiny. But because the author is the diarist, the same cant be confidently said here. The grandiosity and scope of our authors self-pity is, of course, ludicrous, as when he says he will kill himself if he doesnt pass his exams (the phrase he uses  from the heights of despair  was a standard formula in Romanian newspaper reports of suicides, which were appreciated with perverse relish by the public in those days); but there is also the sense that he knows exactly what hes doing and is, moreover, quite playful about the whole exercise. I dont know my neighbours. Why should I? None of them have a daughter. No, I cant put that in the novel. Instead Ill say that its because I despise them. I was worried, at one point, that there might be unpleasant moments of antisemitism. Eliades political beliefs in the runup to the second world war do not cover him with glory (not that he was alone; to be a Romanian with lofty and romantic longings around this time often meant a flirtation with fascism: Eliades friend, the philosopher and aphorist Emil Cioran, who would also renounce such views after the war). The first Jewish student mentioned is not sympathetically observed, but subsequent ones are. And how literate these kids are! When they dont do their homework, its because they are reading Balzac or Dostoevsky  in French. Im not sure that happens any more.

Since then, he has reportedly written eight scientific papers  a startling achievement by any standards. Impressive though it may be, there are suspicions his productivity may not be motivated by academic zeal alone.  Under Romanian law, prisoners can shave 30 days off their jail terms for every book of scientific value that they have published  and it is an opportunity being seized by many white-collar prisoners in a country engaged in an unprecedented crackdown on corruption. While in prison for graft offences, politicians and businessmen in particular are churning out papers in order to take advantage of the loophole, with little in the way of checks to confirm the value or even originality of the works produced. The law has been like this for many years but we havent seen such abuses until recently, said Laura tefan, an anti-corruption expert and a former director in the Romanian ministry of justice. It has come at a time when Romanias anti-corruption push has started to generate convictions.  Related: Bringing in the scalps: the woman leading Romania's war on corruption  According to the countrys prison administration, 415 scientific works written by prisoners were published between the start of 2013 and December 9, 2015. In 2012, there were just seven. There are strong suggestions that many of the books are being written by ghostwriters, or at least heavily guided by outside research assistants, who then pass the text on to the prisoners who handwrite them  the manuscripts must be handwritten rather than typed  and pay for a small print run of a few hundred copies. At present there is little in the way of guidelines or academic rigour on what is worthy of reduced prison time, with parole boards often left to decide on their own. In April 2015, Romanian businessman Gheorghe Copos, who was serving four years in prison, was accused of plagiarism in relation to a book he allegedly wrote, titled: Matrimonial Alliances as a Policy of Romanian Kings in the XIV-XVIth Centuries. He has since been released.  According to Catalin Parfene, a historian who wrote his MA thesis on the subject in 2005, Coposs book has an identical structure, the same historical approach, the same type of argumentation, similar expressions and passages, an identical structure of the ideas in my thesis. It was also, said Parfene, coordinated by his own thesis advisor, although he only knows this because a single copy of the book was sent to the national library as legally required; all other copies were apparently bought by the author.  In June, the University of Bucharest said it was putting together a new commission of experts in order to analyse the two works, but even if the decision goes against Copos, it is unlikely that he will be returned to prison to complete the 30 days. In total, Copos apparently produced five books in his 400 days behind bars; he also got time off for being over 60 and working in the prisons carpentry workshop. Meanwhile, Gigi Becali, the controversial owner of Steaua Bucharest football club, reduced his stay in prison by writing two books, one of which was about his relationship with the football team he owns; while former politician Nicolae Vasilescu has allegedly written nine books since 2014 and jailed businessman Dinel Staicu has had seven titles published in a similar period.  Related: Romanian PM faces calls to step down over corruption allegations  In recent months, some of those involved in Romanias fight against corruption have pushed to have the loophole closed, or at least amended. No one is verifying the scientific value of the work, or if they have time to write these books, said Laura Codrua Kvesi, chief prosecutor at the National Anticorruption Directorate (DNA). People are writing eight, nine, 10 books with no scientific value but are still able to reduce their sentences. This is indirectly affecting the fight against corruption. DNA proposed amendments to the law in April, but so far it remains unchanged, and savvy criminals are making the most of the opportunity to reduce their time behind bars.  This system is unmanageable for Romania right now. If you cant manage it, dont have it, said tefan."

Dan Mihalache said his country paid more than 100,000 to train up one medical student to become a doctor in Romania. That is our contribution to your National Health Service, he told a committee of peers in the House of Lords, adding that there were 10,000 or more Romanians working in the NHS.  Mihalache argued that there were two sides of the coin when it came to free movement within the EU, one good and one bad.  The positive impact for Romania was that its citizens working abroad across the world sent back 7bn in a good year, and between 3bn and 4bn during the economic crisis.  But both he and the Polish ambassador, Arkady Rzegocki, said their governments had considered policies to stem the loss of skilled workers, including ideas around making graduates work for a number of years or pay back the cost of their courses. Of course we are worried about that, said Rzegocki, who said there were 1 million Poles living in the UK, with the vast majority in employment or studying.  We hope that they will start to be coming back. I hope that the situation will improve because weve had a huge economic success ... our GDP is growing every year. He said an improvement in benefits for children in Poland, bringing the levels almost up to those given out in Britain, had persuaded people to remain in the country, and said the numbers coming to the UK had fallen over time.  The men were appearing in front of the Lords EU justice committee, which is carrying out an inquiry into the impact that Brexit could have on the acquired rights of EU migrants in the UK and British migrants elsewhere.  Rzegocki said there had been concern about reports about hate crime against Poles, although he had tried to reassure people that the incidents were few in number. He said he wanted people to have better knowledge about Poland including its contribution during the second world war.  But he said the biggest problem with Brexit was the uncertainty faced by Polish citizens. They are asking about their future, the future of their children, the NHS, he said, arguing that not knowing what might happen was not good for individuals or the economy. Mihalache said that Romanian citizens had been calling his embassy to express similar concerns, including asking questions about their status, rumours that they could be expelled, and questions about permanent residence. What will happen to people who paid their social contributions here in United Kingdom? What will happen to the mechanism, will payments made in UK be paid back  do they have to have registration certificates? he added. The ambassador added that the rhetoric he had heard about registering foreign workers, along the lines of Amber Rudds proposals for a visa scheme post-Brexit, are not encouraging for our communities. The men said their plea was for all existing rights for their citizens to be protected.  Lady Kennedy of the Shaws, who chairs the committee, said she had set up the inquiry after hearing that embassy phone lines had been jammed by EU citizens asking what is going to happen to us? We have bought a house, our children go to school, how do we learn our futures?.  The committee will present its recommendations by the end of the year."

Their first event was the uneven bars, which is a weakness for the team across the board. Though the first competitor hit, the next one up, team veteran Diana Bulimar, fell. But even on hit sets, they were one to two points per routine off the pace of the top programs. </p> <p>Next came beam, traditionally a strength for the Romanian program, who pioneered the <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><c5><93>move quick as a bunny and look great while doing it<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><c2><9d> style of balance beam. But on Sunday, they had two falls there. They added falls on floor and vault, too. At the end of the first subdivision of four, they were sitting in second behind the Australians, a team whose only world medal came in 2003 on a technicality when the Chinese were harshly penalized for flipping on podium while waiting to compete. With stronger teams to come in the later subdivisions, it was inevitable that they would be bumped out of the top four, which would keep them from Olympic qualification.</p> <p>At the end of the day all but one team <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> the South Koreans <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> surpassed them.

He was in Rio, blogging about the Test Event for his site, <a href=""http://gymnasticscoaching.com/new/"">Gymnastics Coaching</a>. He said he thought they had just enough to land in the top four. </p> <p>To be fair, the Romanians were plagued with unusually bad luck in the run up to Sunday, losing their top two gymnasts <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> 2015 world bronze medalist Larisa Iordache and Laura Jurca <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> in the weeks leading up to the test event. The loss of Iordache, in particular, was especially painful. When she<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>s on, she<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>s usually the top scorer for the team on every single apparatus. And she<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>s the only one among them capable of a world class bar routine, boosting their total on that piece by at least two full points. </p> <p>In the past, losing such prized gymnasts wouldn<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>t have put Olympic qualification in doubt.

But when that time came, there was almost no one on the bench. Silvia Zarzu was so weak on the bars they didn<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>t bother putting her in competition on the event even though they had a fall they were looking to drop. </p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""43790ee3d435be1a3bdc0a44d170c4be742bac67""> <img src=""https://media.guim.co.uk/43790ee3d435be1a3bdc0a44d170c4be742bac67/0_180_4900_2940/1000.jpg"" alt=""Romania gymnastics"" width=""1000"" height=""600"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Romania<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>s Anamaria Ocolisan performs at the balance beam during the artistic gymnastics test event for Rio 2016.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>More significantly, in the good ol<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2> days of Romanian gymnastics, they wouldn<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>t have been forced to qualify to the Games in April of the Olympic year. They would<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>ve already taken care of this at the previous world championships by placing in the top eight among all of the teams. </p> <p>At the 2015 worlds in Glasgow, the Romanians self-destructed on the uneven bars with all but one gymnast falling off. These grievous errors, along with weak performances on their traditional strengths, floor and vault, sent them plummeting down the standings to 13th place. This meant that they would not make the team finals. And more importantly, their Olympic qualification was in doubt for the first time in 40 years <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> since Nadia Comaneci put Romania on the map for something other than vampires. </p> <p>But 2015 was not the first indication that something was rotten in the state of Romanian gymnastics. The signs were there for years. At the 2014 world championships, the team almost missed out on team finals but was saved by the weakness of the field and a heroic performance from Iordache, who single-handedly dragged them into the top eight after preliminaries. </p> <p>Back in 2010 and 2011, the team failed to medal for the first time in, well, ever. These results prompted officials to bring back legendary coaches Octavian Bellu and Mariana Bitang, who led the team to two Olympic team titles and a streak of world championships wins from 1994-2001. Also, former gymnasts like Catalina Ponor, a triple gold medalist in 2004, came out of retirement to help improve the team<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>s ranking. Her technical firepower on beam and floor (along with a decent vault) was the main reason the Romanians were able to edge China for the bronze in London. This result, along with individual medals for Ponor and Sandra Izbasa, a veteran of the 2008 Games, papered over the problems that were plaguing the program. As long as you win a medal at the Olympics, things can<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>t be that bad, can they?</p> <p> Ponor, who is now 28, came out of retirement yet again to help the Romanians qualify to Rio, was not able to save them though she really, really tried. After an aggressive beam set and a sultry floor performance (where she is the defending Olympic silver medalist), she went to vault, an event she has barely trained in this comeback due to an injury. Rather than going for a simple vault, Ponor went for broke, going for a double twisting Yurchenko. She seemed to have gotten lost in the air and didn<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>t complete any of the rotations.

When they exited two hours later, it was clear that the team that had introduced Nadia Comaneci and the Perfect 10 40 years ago would not be sending a squad to Brazil in the summer.  Related: 50 stunning Olympic moments No5: Nadia Comaneci scores a perfect 10 | Simon Burnton  Everything started going wrong for the Romanians almost from the minute they saluted the judges and stepped out onto the mint green podium. Their first event was the uneven bars, which is a weakness for the team across the board. Though the first competitor hit, the next one up, team veteran Diana Bulimar, fell. But even on hit sets, they were one to two points per routine off the pace of the top programs.  Next came beam, traditionally a strength for the Romanian program, who pioneered the move quick as a bunny and look great while doing it style of balance beam. But on Sunday, they had two falls there. They added falls on floor and vault, too. At the end of the first subdivision of four, they were sitting in second behind the Australians, a team whose only world medal came in 2003 on a technicality when the Chinese were harshly penalized for flipping on podium while waiting to compete. With stronger teams to come in the later subdivisions, it was inevitable that they would be bumped out of the top four, which would keep them from Olympic qualification. At the end of the day all but one team  the South Koreans  surpassed them. Even Switzerland moved ahead of them in the final tally. I was surprised, Rick McCharles, a former Canadian judge and coach, told the Guardian in an email. He was in Rio, blogging about the Test Event for his site, Gymnastics Coaching. He said he thought they had just enough to land in the top four.  To be fair, the Romanians were plagued with unusually bad luck in the run up to Sunday, losing their top two gymnasts  2015 world bronze medalist Larisa Iordache and Laura Jurca  in the weeks leading up to the test event. The loss of Iordache, in particular, was especially painful. When shes on, shes usually the top scorer for the team on every single apparatus. And shes the only one among them capable of a world class bar routine, boosting their total on that piece by at least two full points.  In the past, losing such prized gymnasts wouldnt have put Olympic qualification in doubt. Romania would have replaced the injured athletes with other capable gymnasts  perhaps not stars in their own right but able to get the job done. But when that time came, there was almost no one on the bench. Silvia Zarzu was so weak on the bars they didnt bother putting her in competition on the event even though they had a fall they were looking to drop.  More significantly, in the good ol days of Romanian gymnastics, they wouldnt have been forced to qualify to the Games in April of the Olympic year. They wouldve already taken care of this at the previous world championships by placing in the top eight among all of the teams.  At the 2015 worlds in Glasgow, the Romanians self-destructed on the uneven bars with all but one gymnast falling off. These grievous errors, along with weak performances on their traditional strengths, floor and vault, sent them plummeting down the standings to 13th place. This meant that they would not make the team finals. And more importantly, their Olympic qualification was in doubt for the first time in 40 years  since Nadia Comaneci put Romania on the map for something other than vampires.  But 2015 was not the first indication that something was rotten in the state of Romanian gymnastics. The signs were there for years. At the 2014 world championships, the team almost missed out on team finals but was saved by the weakness of the field and a heroic performance from Iordache, who single-handedly dragged them into the top eight after preliminaries.  Back in 2010 and 2011, the team failed to medal for the first time in, well, ever. These results prompted officials to bring back legendary coaches Octavian Bellu and Mariana Bitang, who led the team to two Olympic team titles and a streak of world championships wins from 1994-2001. Also, former gymnasts like Catalina Ponor, a triple gold medalist in 2004, came out of retirement to help improve the teams ranking. Her technical firepower on beam and floor (along with a decent vault) was the main reason the Romanians were able to edge China for the bronze in London. This result, along with individual medals for Ponor and Sandra Izbasa, a veteran of the 2008 Games, papered over the problems that were plaguing the program. As long as you win a medal at the Olympics, things cant be that bad, can they?  Ponor, who is now 28, came out of retirement yet again to help the Romanians qualify to Rio, was not able to save them though she really, really tried. After an aggressive beam set and a sultry floor performance (where she is the defending Olympic silver medalist), she went to vault, an event she has barely trained in this comeback due to an injury. Rather than going for a simple vault, Ponor went for broke, going for a double twisting Yurchenko. She seemed to have gotten lost in the air and didnt complete any of the rotations. She crashed badly. We have said after the competitions in Sydney [2000] and Athens [2004] that things will not work forever because of the individual brilliance of someone like Andreea Raducan, Simona Amanar, or Catalina Ponor, Bellu said in an interview following the disastrous result. There needs to be investment and organization at the grassroots level. You cant keep bringing your old stars out of retirement. And you cant cram for the Olympics as you would for an exam.  Bellu also cast some of the blame onto the gymnasts themselves. I have my doubts regarding the girls who are now in the quad. I have the feeling theyre not motivated enough or dont like the sport, he said. I tried during these past months, together with Mariana Bitang, to help out but we couldnt really do much, as the girls were mostly injured.  Paul Ziert, however, the publisher of International Gymnast Magazine, laid some of the blame for the teams poor performance at the feet of Bellu, Bitang, and the Romanian gymnastics federation, which panicked in the face of poor results and changed the teams coaching situation multiple times in the last few months. He also noted that neither Bellu nor Bitang were in Rio with the team. What messages does that send to this largely inexperienced team of talented young women? he asked in an open letter published on the magazines Facebook page. One does not need to be a PhD in Psychology to know that their not going would easily bred thoughts that this team was an embarrassment to them. Bitang asserted that Ziert was wrong in his assessment, that it didnt matter whether or not they, who were volunteers, not staff coaches, were present with the team. And, she noted, that this was also largely a matter of resources, pointing out that countries like Belgium had greatly invested in the sport and had results to show for it. At the test event, Belgium qualified their first full team to the Olympics since 1948.  Something has to change in the Romanian gymnastics school or things will keep getting worse, Bellu commented.  McCharles is not optimistic that the Romanians can rejoin the top echelon of teams. Im not sure we will ever again see Romania one of the top four nations, he said. The country is poor, its population is shrinking, and they dont have nearly as many elite training facilities as their competitors do. They will have individual stars, but it may be that nations including Great Britain, Canada and France have now surpassed them for the long term.  As Romanias star has fallen, new countries have risen to take its place. In 2015, Great Britain won its first ever team medal  a bronze  at the world championships. There are other countries whose programs are also on the rise. Italy has placed as high as fourth in the past. And the Netherlands will be sending its first full team to the Olympics since 1976 by virtue of their eighth place finish in 2015.  McCharles conceded that the 2016 Olympics will probably not be as exciting without Romania. But that doesnt mean that the future for the sport globally speaking is bleak. When new nations challenge USA, China, and Russia, well be able to move on to the new normal, he said. Forty years after Nadia, the new normal has started  an Olympic Games without Romanian gymnastics. "

Alexandru Visinescu, 90, was sentenced to 20 years in jail last last July after being found guilty of running a regime of extermination at the jail outside the small town of Rmnicu Srat, 90 miles east of the capital, from 1956 to 1963.  The prisoners, members of Romanias pre-war intellectual, political, and military elite, were held in solitary confinement in unheated cells, subjected to regular beatings, severely underfed, and denied access to medical treatment.  At least 14 of the 138 inmates who were detained at Rmnicu Srat during the seven years Visinescu was in charge at the jail died, prosecutors said, while many more were permanently disfigured or traumatised. The first prison commander to face trial since Romanias former dictator Nicolae Ceauescu was executed in 1989, Visinescu, who was not in court to hear the verdict on Wednesday, has shown little remorse, insisting he was merely following orders and blaming the Stalinist regime of Ceausescus predecessor, Gheorghe Gheroghe-Dej.  Asked six times at his appeal hearing in the high court of cassation last month why prisoners had died under his command, he replied just once, suggesting they had probably died of old age, before breaking down and pleading: Let me die.  Survivors of his regime have described being banned from sitting on their beds except at nighttime, or from approaching cell walls in case they used morse code to communicate with each other.  The widow of one detainee, General Ion Eremia, who spent 14 years in the prison, said her husband was forced to spend hours standing with his bare feet in a bucket of freezing water and left the jail weighing barely 30 kilos.  The ruling marks a significant moment in Romanias efforts to bring to justice communist-era figures accused of wrongdoing. While a handful of top officials were convicted of genocide in the 1990s, most of the charges were later reduced and many of those found guilty were released on health grounds.  According to the Institute for Investigation of Communist Crimes and Memory of Romanian Exile (IICCMRE), which initiated the case against Visinescu, up to 2 million Romanians were killed, unjustly imprisoned, deported or relocated during nearly half a century of communist repression. Historians have said more than 600,000 dissidents  including landowners, politicians, priests, lawyers, doctors, writers, teachers and students  were jailed for crimes against the state from the late 1940s onwards.

It blames corruption, still widespread in Romania, for the fact that so far only Visinescu  who was living openly in central Bucharest on a special military pension  has been sentenced.  Andrei Muraru, the organisations former head, said he was gratified by Wednesdays ruling. It is a historic sentence because, starting from this moment, any crimes committed in the communist era can be condemned, Muraru told the Associated Press.  The IICCMREs current chief, Radu Preda, described Visinescus trial last year as particularly important because for the first time, an instrument of communist terror will face justice. Without hyperbole, this amounts to a Romanian Nuremberg, he said. "

Romanian state prosecutors questioned Ponta on Tuesday about allegations that he misused his authority as leader of the Social Democratic party to persuade Blair to come to Romania.  They accuse Ponta of offering Sebastian Ghita, a local businessman, a seat in parliament in exchange for paying 220,000 (184,000) to cover the costs of a visit by a political figure. Ghita told the Mediafax news agency that this figure was Blair. Prosecutors said Ponta arranged the visit so it looked as if it had been initiated and organised by non-political groups, and that he benefited from press coverage of the visit.  Blairs office said it was contacted by the Multimedia Foundation for Local Democracy to make the speech, and that the contact came via an American thinktank, the Centre for American Progress. Blair was paid a substantial fee for giving a lecture on the future of Europe, with the money passed in its entirety to one of his charities. In exchange for sponsoring the visit, Ponta, who was prime minister from 2012 to 2015, allegedly promoted Ghita within the party to help him win a parliamentary seat and a four-year term in the chamber of deputies. Ponta and Ghita both deny wrongdoing.  Related: Anger over Bucharest nightclub fire spirals into demands for PM to resign  Blair was not under investigation for any wrongdoing, a spokeswoman for the prosecutors said, and there was no suggestion that he was aware of any of the fallout from his visit. Ponta is being investigated on suspicion of using his authority to obtain money, goods or other improper benefits and being an accomplice to money laundering. Prosecutors put Ponta under judicial control  the equivalent of bail  meaning he has to report to prosecutors, needs to get permission to leave the country, cannot talk publicly about the inquiry or make public comments about prosecutors. Ponta is currently on trial in a separate case for corruption-related charges stemming from work he did as a lawyer from 2007 to 2008. He denies wrongdoing.  Ponta became prime minister in 2012. He resigned in 2015 in the face of mass protests sparked by a fire in a nightclub that killed more than 30 people and led to claims of wider corruption and ineptitude.

Almost no one dares go down into the park itself; the perimeter wall  a five-metre concrete embankment that isolates this unique green space from the surrounding city  remains the favourite and safest spot.  From an unfinished piece of urban water infrastructure abandoned in 1989, Vcreti has been reconquered by nature and wildlife without any human intervention, to become one of Romanias most diverse ecosystems. Last month, following a four-year campaign led by a small but determined group of environmental activists, the government finally granted it protected area status, officially making 183-hectare Vcreti one of the biggest urban nature parks in Europe. The diversity of landscapes is fascinating. The northern edge is a meadow with wild grass, nut trees, poplars and elms, but venture deeper into the park, towards the three interconnected lakes at its heart, and the vegetation becomes denser and more characteristic of wetlands: various types of willow, Johnson grass and water lilies. Along the way you will also come across some of the 100-odd species of bird that have been spotted in Vcreti  from wild ducks to herons. With luck, you might also see a turtle or fire-bellied toad  two protected species that have flourished in these untouched surroundings.  Vcreti was originally a neighbourhood of Bucharest, built under communist rule on land reclaimed from swamps to make room for several grand architectural projects, including new buildings for the Ministry of Justice and Supreme Court, and an artificial basin, Lake Vcreti  part of an ambitious hydrological infrastructure plan to connect Bucharest to the river Danube.  None of these projects would be completed. In 1989, the Romanian revolution removed President Nicolae Ceauescu from power. He was executed, and his grand schemes abandoned. While the lake was at an advanced stage of completion, a major engineering defect made it almost useless. And that is how Vcreti remained: an empty lake, hidden behind high dykes, in the middle of one of Europes densest cities.  Related: Hands off #OurLand: gifting green space to QPR highlights wider threat to cities  On a stormy day 27 years later, Dan Brbulescu and Cristian Lascu explain the genesis of their fight to turn Vcreti into a protected nature park, as defined by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. It all started in 2012, when Lascu  who was editor-in-chief of National Geographic Romania for 20 years  published an article headlined The delta between the blocks. Nature photographer Helmut Ignat had been spending a year photographing Vcretis wildlife; his pictures showed that over the two decades since the infrastructure project had been abandoned, nature had developed within the low-lying land in a staggering way, creating a genuine ecosystem whose diversity came as a shock to many people. There are several sites in Bucharest with a similar history: grand projects ordered by communist leader Ceauescu that remained unfinished after the 1989 revolution, entangled in overwhelming red tape, thorny legal feuds and a lack of interest from investors. Yet while most of these are now simply ruins or barren land, Vcreti has regenerated itself in the most astonishing way.  In 2013, the Romanian Academy (the highest scientific authority in Romania) undertook a study of its fauna and flora, which confirmed the extent of this ecosystem: hundreds of species of plants and flowers, 96 species of birds, several mammals including weasels and otters  a European protected species  but also reptiles including turtles and snakes.  We have no idea how otters arrived in Vcreti, says Brbulescu, executive director of the Vcreti Nature Park Association, which led the fight to make Vcreti a protected area. But it certainly shows how clear and good quality the water is. As we climb up the concrete embankment that separates the polder from the built-up area surrounding it, Lascu tells me: Vcreti is the perfect combination of luck and natures resilience. The embankment around the lake has protected the area from the citys interference. And the layer of clay at the bottom of the lake means that it is connected to one of Bucharests five main aquifers, providing fresh water that you can actually drink. We pause at the top of the embankment which supports some sort of walled walkway. There are a few joggers and walkers around minding their own business. A barren concrete slope goes down to the bottom of the lake. To face this vast and luxuriant cistern is slightly frightening. It looks wild and vividly green, contrasting starkly with the surrounding city that is grey and mineral.  Imagine yourself looking down at an area larger than Regents Park in London, but untamed. As we move to the bottom of the basin the atmosphere is eerie yet comforting at the same time: the embankment and the abundant vegetation create a buffer that stops the noise of the city from reaching us. The Roma families that have settled here have even become part of the ecosystem of the lake, says Lascu. It seems that the relationship between those living in informal housing and the nature activists has not always been ideal, but now Brbulescu adds that Gica, head of one of the Roma families, has been key in helping the association tackle the issues of poachers, illegal logging and fishermen.  Related: Hyde and seek: can you identify the city park from the satellite image?  Protecting the area from abuse  people having BBQs, leaving debris and garbage, and the threat of thieves and poachers  is one of the main challenges for the association. At the western edge of the park, despite the many campaigns to clean the area, theres a lot of debris including a fridge, tyres, clothes, plastic bags and hundreds of broken decorated tiles. As a protected area we hope that we will be able to hire Gica as Vcretis first ranger, says Brbulescu. Though, as we get ready for a boat ride on the pond, Lascu gives a reproachful glance to the future ranger when he casually throws his cigarette butt in the water.  Despite the campaigns success  a social media strategy documenting the diverse wildlife on a daily basis has contributed to their 60,000 likes on Facebook  theres still some way to go. One of the tasks ahead for the young park is to have the area ready to welcome the public, without damaging the ecosystem or losing what makes this place so extraordinary. The main challenge now is to create an organisation that will manage the park, says Brbulescu. They hope to be that organisation, but they need to demonstrate that they have the financial ability to do so  there is no automatic funding available for newly created parks in Romania. We still need support locally and internationally. Id love to have Sir David Attenborough coming to visit Vcreti. I think Ill write him a letter.

The tensions, which surfaced earlier this month, have escalated to the point where government ministers and even the prime minister have stepped in to try to find a solution. On Wednesday, the Romanian culture minister resigned amid the escalating row. A day earlier, Romanian media published a letter written by the state-run opera houses human resources department stating that Johan Kobborg, the Danish choreographer who resigned as artistic director, star dancer Alina Cojocaru and seven others were banned from entering the building unless accompanied by security.  This came despite the culture minister, Vlad Alexandrescu, announcing last Wednesday that a compromise had been reached that would allow Kobborg and Cojocaru to return. The crisis began on 12 April, when Kobborg, who had been brought in to help raise the reputation of the company and bring in foreign performers and productions, resigned as artistic director after two years in the post.  Kobborg had clashed with the operas new management, appointed after problems with the previous team were made apparent to the culture ministry, and took offence to his title being changed from artistic director to simply being included among the list of artists on its website, though he says this wasnt the reason he resigned. Instead, Kobborg wrote in his resignation letter, his decision was due to the fact that under the new management dancers were intimidated and threatened and that lies were used to blame artists for the actions of the management.  I fear for what the future might bring for the Opera Nationala Bucuresti and for the credibility of Romanian culture and the light in which Romanian culture will be viewed, he added.  About 30 dancers gathered in front of the opera house in Bucharest in a show of support for Kobborg, announcing they wouldnt perform in any upcoming productions. A counter-demonstration took place, with the operas Romanian employeesa supporting management and protesting about, among other things, the wage disparity between local dancers and those brought in from abroad.  The Romanian dancers are paid Ron 1,000-2,000 [180-355] while Mr Kobborg gets 7,300 [5,800], Cristina Cotescu, one of the operas directors, told local media at the time, adding that Kobborg recruited only foreigners and that he marginalised the Romanians.  Two days later, the prime minister, Dacian Ciolos, met Cojocaru, a Romanian ballerina and Kobborgs fiancee. Bucharest National Opera needs valuable artists and performances, he wrote on Facebook. I am sure that we can respect our values, in the same way we can respect a remarkable artist or artistic act whether they come from Romania or elsewhere  beyond any differences in administrative opinions, the xenophobic discourse has no place in a Romania that wants to be open to the world. The situation appeared to be coming close to being resolved last Wednesday, when Alexandrescu announced a solution had been agreed upon, with the opera company reappointing George Calin as interim manager for three months, after which a new manager of international stature would be brought in. Kobborg and Cojocaru would also return, he said. However, many of those belonging to the company continued to protest, saying no consensus had been reached. There was no real agreement, but the communication of a decision, Tiberiu Soare, the acting deputy director of the opera company, said in a statement sent to the press and company employees. Calin was subsequently removed from his post, the third interim manager in a matter of weeks. Many now fear for the long-term reputation of the Romanian national opera. The deputy prime minister, Vasile Dincu, held talks at the opera house with employees for more than two hours on Tuesday. Among their demands were an audit of the operas financial operations for the last three years and the appointment of a replacement for Kobborg."

On 65 minutes the support sang Stand up if you love Joe Hart and the Etihad Stadium rose to create a moment that was touching and one the under-pressure goalkeeper may never forget. It was that kind of night throughout. The actual game was academic given the 5-0 lead City held over Steaua Bucharest from last weeks opening leg in Romania. Hart had finally been selected by the manager for the sides fourth match of the season, and asked to help seal a place for City in Thursdays Champions League group stage draw. This they duly did, and Guardiolas choice of captain was classy. Hart wore the armband as Yaya Tour also made a first appearance of the season. The Ivorian lined up in an XI that showed eight changes from Saturdays 4-1 dismantling of Stoke City.  Related: Joe Hart enjoys special night but Pep Guardiola stands by demotion decision  The evening began with Hart offering a thumbs-up to applauding fans following his warm-up and cheers from them when his first touch with a boot proved a sure-footed pass. As a super-sized banner was unfurled bearing the legend THIS IS YOUR CITY with a picture of Guardiola over a streetscape of Manchester landmarks, the Catalans full-backs were again adopting a tactic first spotted on opening day here. This featured Gal Clichy and the 19-year-old Spaniard Pablo Maffeo, a right-back on debut, moving infield to become de facto midfielders when City attacked. Also notable was the near-constant conversation Guardiola had with John Stones in the opening part of the half. The central defender took instructions on where and when to pass and was told as vehemently to relay similar instructions to defensive colleagues. Stones was also a main channel via which much of Citys play began, stroking long and short passes around in the manner for which he was bought. After 25 minutes there had been scant action in either goalmouth. Nolito managed one volley on the turn, though it was hit weakly at Valentin Cojocaru in the visiting goal. Later Fabian Delph, who partnered Fernando in midfield, found space and fired a low shot but again it failed to trouble the goalkeeper. Hart did not deal as smoothly with a Steaua corner. When it was delivered he rose to punch the ball away only to be left flapping as Tour beat him to it. This was the closest Laurentiu Reghecampfs team had come to clawing back one of the five unanswered goals they required to take this tie into extra time. Three minutes before the interval Hart mis-controlled a regulation backpass, hardly helping to support the idea Guardiola is unfairly maligning him for a clumsy touch. The Catalans drive for perfection meant he would demand a step up in quality for the second half. As Hart wandered to the goal before the south stand he was regaled with Citys No1 and, wryly, Hell pass when he wants. There did indeed follow some deft control and an offload with his right boot, and he watched as seconds later Stones rose in Steauas area. The former Everton mans header was wide of Cojocarus right post, however. Eight minutes after the interval Reghecampf made a move, taking off Adnan Aganovic and Ovidiu Popescu for Adrian Popa and Nicolae Stanciu, the latter a player who is interesting Premier League clubs. It did not help Steaua as City promptly roved towards Cojocarus goal and opened the scoring. This was regulation stuff as Jess Navas stood the ball up and Delph headed expertly past the keeper. It was the midfielders third goal for the club and took City to a 60 aggregate lead. It also meant Guardiola could make his own substitutions and rest two key men. Off came Nolito for the 19-year-old Jos Tasende  also known as Angelio  and Stones for Tosin Adarabioyo, 18  both were making their bows in the competition. The City manager stopped Stones as he strode past to have yet another word regarding tactics and in-game strategy, during what was now a glorified training session. There was also chat with Aleksandar Kolarov about similar matters during a stop in play moments later. Then came the home faithful taking to their feet to applaud Hart, the keeper appearing to touch the City crest and showing understandable emotion. Harts concentration held still, though, as at one point he, fresh from a vote of confidence from England manager Sam Allardyce, raced out to hoof the ball to safety, and in another ensured his defence marshalled a rare Steaua attack. A late injury to Kelechi Iheanacho  he pulled up when chasing a ball down, and Guardiola later said he does not know how serious the problem is  was the only sour note. Unless you are Hart, of course, who acknowledged the stands at length after the final whistle. Despite the sentiment, deep down he will be hurting."

These performers  from lonely singers to bigger bands  play all kinds of music to warm the hearts of passers by on the streets of Bucharest. There is no best building in Bucharest, but there are many great buildings with complicated stories, and the Hotel Cismigiu is probably my favourite. Its not necessarily my favourite because of its story, but because of its beauty, which has withstood periods of dilapidationd. It can be found on one of the decaying boulevards of central Bucharest, it was called Palace Hotel when it was first built in 1913. It hosted a hotel, and later a cinema and brewery. It was bombed by the Brits and Americans in 1944 and nationalised by the communists in 1948. In the early nineties it acted as dorms for students from the universitys theatre faculty but was in really bad shape  one of the my favourite childhood bands Vama Veche even sang a song about this era. In the mid-nineties it was closed down but in 2012 it was renovated and now hosts another brewery, a fancy hotel and the Cervantes centre. Last year, The Future Nuggets  a group of Romanian producers, diggers and musicians  started making covers of manele songs from the 90s. Manele is a Balkanic Romanian-Roma music style that is very popular among marginalised groups in society. They mixed manele tracks they found on trilulilu.ro, Youtube, and on tapes and vinyls bought online or at flea markets, with electronic sounds to make what they call psychedelic manele. This way, the music became popular in communities of hipsters, artists, and young intellectuals.  The group play in clubs and bars and their songs are also played at parties organised by the citys Paradaiz collective. There has been a lot of discussion around the use of violence in parental discipline. Last November, Norwegian authorities took the five Bodnariu children away from their parents (a Romanian man and his Norwegian wife) who allegedly abused them, but the family complained that there was no proper investigation. Protests have been organised by Romanians in front of Norwegian embassies around the world. Last week, a Romanian delegation visited Norway in order to ask authorities to return the children  this might happen anytime soon. In Bucharest, it sparked a debate. Is it okay for the state to take children away from their parents and place them in foster homes? Statistics show that 63% of Romanians use violence against their children. Former journalist and mother Oana Dobre started the #37lasuta (37%) community for people who want to fight against using corporal punishment as a discipline technique on children. Care Caf is in a house built in 1893 that used to belong to an obstetrician. Later, under communism in order to not be nationalised, it became the living quarters of seven families who had been evicted from their houses. Its now a cafe with delicious, affordable food, but it seems to often be empty.  Next to the cafe, in the same building, is a small bookshop called Hecate that has a great selection of books, some more radical than in the regular bookshops elsewhere in town. Topics range from feminism to marginal communities, critical thinking, equality and solidarity. Hecate considers itself a new hub of respect for differences, critical thinking and change. From book openings and discussions, to flea markets and pet adoptions, the house also hosts events. Andrei Pungovschis photos are some of the best of Bucharest on Instagram. The photojournalist sometimes shares the intimate moments of his family, friends and pet dog, while in other photos you get a glimpse into the everyday life of the city. In this photo, people are riding the metro in Bucharest as part of an event called No Pants Subway Ride.

On December 21, Ceausescu called for a demonstration in Bucharest in order to condemn the protests taking place against his regime in the western Romanian city of Timisoara. But while he was talking people started booing and he famously responded: Hello, comrades, please stay quiet in your places; I will add another hundred to your salary. The demonstration dispersed, but a few people gathered in a nearby plaza and initiated a protest against his regime, causing the dictator to flee. He was executed a few days later in Targoviste after a mock trial. Violence continued around the city and over a thousand people died across the country; people now know that the popular protest was taken over by a handful of dignitaries who were already planning to topple Ceausescu. Romania then entered a post-communist period in which it opened towards the west and embraced turbo-capitalism. Veda Popovici is a 28-year-old feminist and political artist who lives in Bucharest. She is interested in anti-authoritarianism and radical anarchism, and is part of the collective running a social centre called Claca (meaning a collective voluntary work, organised by peasants for helping each other, sometimes followed by a small party, in English). Last summer she made a video called A History of Art Retold Through the Black Square, where she retells the history of art though the female body, using Malevichs Black Square as a revolutionary tool. Other work includes a Migrants Monument which was erected in the main bus station from where Romanians leave towards the west. Get lost: the best thing about Bucharest is the surprises it offers you if you allow yourself to stray off the crowded main boulevards. The architecture is beautiful and diverse, with buildings from different periods with complicated histories. And since its still winter, you should definitely go ice skating on the lake in the park in Cismigiu. Or stay warm in the new tropical paradise spa, Therme, just outside town.

Some of the women have been arrested by officers during raids intended to break up trafficking rings. The women, mainly Romanian, have received letters from Operation Nexus officers giving them about a months notice that they are liable to be detained and put on a flight back to Bucharest. EU nationals administrative removal on the grounds of not observing their treaty rights can be challenged by arguing that they are studying, working, seeking employment, self-employed or economically self-sufficient in the UK. If removed, EU nationals are banned from re-entering the UK for 12 months. Several women fighting deportation are now being supported by the English Collective of Prostitutes (ECP). There was a raid which was supposed to be saving victims from trafficking, explained one young woman who wished to remain anonymous. The police took paperwork and money. I asked for a receipt. They said I was being cheeky. They wanted to know if had been trafficked and asked the client if I was taking drugs. He said no.  They didnt arrest me but said I should be deported and asked me to go to the police station. I went along with a lawyer and showed a letter from a course proving that I was studying English. The threat to remove her was eventually dropped. Maria, not her real name, was stopped on the street and taken to a police station. I was held for 24 hours, the 25-year-old said. A week later I received a letter [saying I would be removed].  Victoria, again a pseudonym, was arrested at her flat and questioned about running a brothel. I was never charged, the 21-year-old said, but I was sent a letter. They have taken my passport and said that if my appeal is not successful I will be deported. Here you can earn money more easily than in Romania; you can have a better future. I cant find a normal job. Some of the women who were sent removal letters are now planning to challenge them on the grounds that they are exercising their treaty rights through being self-employed in the sex industry. Previous EU law cases have established that prostitution constitutes self-employment.  Niki Adams, a spokeswoman for the ECP, said: This deliberate policy of deportation and destitution targets immigrant women, who because of the criminalisation and stigma associated with sex work, will find it harder to defend themselves.  All the women are mothers who went into sex work because wages in other jobs were too low to feed and clothe their children or because they faced racism from employers.  Emma Lough, a solicitor from the London-based Aire Centre, which specialises in European legal rights, said: Often people receive removal proceedings from the Home Office following information being built up by Operation Nexus police officers, which has been shown to have a disproportionate impact on certain groups and sex workers are one of them. EU law recognises sex work for the purposes of being a worker but its hard to provide evidence for it and therefore to show that you have exercisable rights. Its difficult to show employment records. The procedure of administrative removal means removing those deemed not to be exercising treaty rights. We see a lot of 19/20-year-old girls who have lived in the UK most of their lives, got caught up in drugs and petty crime and are now facing deportation to a country where they may not speak the language. The Home Office have to demonstrate that someone poses some risk to society in order to justify a deportation decision. However, we see deportation decisions based on very low levels of risk without adequate consideration of the likely harm. The Aire Centre is also preparing a separate challenge to the legality of Operation Nexus based on other cases, not related to sex work.  Operation Nexus operates through embedding immigration officers in police stations. It targets both foreign offenders and those breaching immigration regulations.   Thousands of people  including many with criminal records  have been removed from the UK under Operation Nexus since 2012 although the Home Office declines to confirm precise numbers. The operational and intelligence co-operation between immigration and police has been spread out to forces beyond London. "

During Via Sport, a 750-metre stretch of the Kiseleff highway is closed to vehicles from 10pm on Friday until 2pm on Sunday, to create a safe space for leisure and sports. Yet its a Saturday morning in late July, and rather than looking out over hundreds of children and adults playing games, we are sitting on a bench watching a slow stream of cars go by, perhaps two dozen every minute or so.  A few days earlier, the event organisers had received a letter saying that due to road upkeep over the next four months, Via Sport couldnt take place. This came in the wake of recent comments made by the new mayor of Bucharest, Gabriela Firea, which some feel threatens many of the cultural and sporting events that take place on streets in the Romanian capital. Just this weekend, the traffic in the capital was blocked and not because there were too many cars  but because there are many street events approved in downtown Bucharest, whether cultural, entertainment or sports, and this doesnt happen in any [other] European capital, said Firea  who was elected mayor on 5 June  in a recent interview with one of Romanias news stations. Despite apparently supporting street events in Bucharest, she added that they shouldnt be held in the central area. Firea highlighted Via Sport as one of the events that was affecting traffic  leading many people to question the true motivation for shutting down the event  as well as the concerts that take place in Piata Constitutiei, a large square in front of the Palace of Parliament in the city centre. Tens of thousands pay to attend live shows there and it is one of the most popular venues in the city. In recent years there has been an explosion of street festivals and events taking place in Bucharest, which has added to the cultural and sporting fabric of the city. It is a vibrant city, and a city that is working. It is active, it is not asleep anymore. Culture is part of that, says Raluca Ciuta, the manager for Bucharests bid to become the European Capital of Culture in 2021 and the cultural programmes director at ARCUB, a centre that organises hundreds of events around the city. Yet, at a time when many cities around the world are trying to push for increased street festivals and pedestrianised activities, Bucharest city hall seems to be going against the grain. Following the success of last Septembers first car-free day in Paris, the citys mayor, Anne Hidalgo, decided that the Champs lyses would be closed to cars the first Sunday of every month starting in May, with pedestrians taking over the street. Other cities  from Mumbai to So Paulo  have also been opening up their roads and boulevards to pedestrian activities on weekends, to better encourage people to get out, walk around and have fun. Meanwhile, some cities are taking more drastic action to limit the presence of cars in city centres. If this is permanent I think it is a backward step for Bucharest, says Ciprian Salceanu, a software programmer who goes to Via Sport at least once a month to play table tennis and basketball with friends. Defending her decision to close Via Sport due to roadworks, Firea said in an interview on 26 July that she would not take lessons from a company that stubbornly keeps five people on the boulevard while blocking hundreds of thousands of people in their cars. (Firea didnt respond to requests for an interview with The Guardian.) Zamfir admits that at certain times of the day, when it is very hot, there are not so many people out but says in total they get between 5,000-8,000 people every weekend. Maybe 2pm is not busy, but the morning is the time families come, and on a hot day people will stay playing until three to four in the morning. A few days after her initial comments, Firea tried to clarify her position. She stated that major street events would be safe, and she was simply talking about events that were not well attended or those that could be moved to other areas of the city and off the major boulevards. However, organisers of other street events in Bucharest are not convinced, and some are bracing for more actions from city hall. I believe they will also try to close other street events. I dont know if they will succeed, but we are definitely going to put up a fight, says Cristian Neagoe, who is concerned for the future of his own event, Street Delivery, which was inspired by Londons Reclaim the Streets movement, and has been running for a decade, blocking off a street in central Bucharest for several days every summer. Neagoe says that Street Deliverys whole vision relies on getting the automobile out of the city centre and highlighting the needs of pedestrians, promoting bikes and public transport  We cannot move it in a park or indoors, because that would defeat its whole purpose. Before being told the event was closed due to four months of road maintenance (which precludes the event from resuming this year), Via Sports organisers were offered alternative venues to host their event. They offered us a boulevard almost literally outside the city, far away from any metro station or residential buildings, says Zamfir. The second option was the entrance to a park, but they decided it wasnt right for their event and its goal of offering people an alternative place to play sports and highlight different uses for the citys roads. For the moment, Via Sport is the only event that has been impacted, and it is unsure whether it will spread to other street events and festivals, but there is a feeling that actions in recent weeks show a lack of policy. I think the conversation is pretty chaotic, says Ioana Paun, a Romanian theatre director and performer. It is important that there is a public strategy for cultural events. The mayor shouldnt just approve or disapprove but should help shape public life, she adds. On Thursday 28 July, around 70 people gathered outside Bucharest city hall to skip, play badminton, hopscotch and hit tennis balls as part of a small flashmob protest against the decision to close Via Sport.  It isnt the numbers that matter but the message, and the message is that we should give priority to health over traffic, says Mircea Toma, the president of Active Watch, a Romanian transparency NGO that was behind the flashmob. Bucharest is the second most polluted capital in the EU because the centre is flooded by cars, Toma says, while stressing that in his opinion the mayors approach to shutting down street events was autocratic. She announces she doesnt agree with them and then imposes a decision using maintenance work as an excuse, he says.  Related: How nature turned a failed communist plan into Bucharest's unique urban park  In fact, one of the rumours circulating on social and local media is that Firea targeted Via Sport partly because her political partys headquarters are just north of where it takes place, and they have been affected by traffic on the weekends. The closure of Via Sport may now improve traffic, but few believe it will make much of a difference to drivers. At the most we might add five, six minutes to your journey. Not much time if you ask us, says Zamfir, adding: It feels like city hall is saying traffic is more important than fresh air over the weekend.

The prime minister reiterated his proposal on a trip to Romania and before a visit to Poland, two of the countries that are most strongly opposed to it. He is visiting both countries in the hope of making progress on his attempted renegotiation of the terms of Britains EU membership before a meeting of the European Council next week. Speaking in Bucharest after a meeting with Romanias president, Klaus Iohannis, Cameron made clear he was still pursuing his fourth renegotiation request, to allow the UK to bar EU migrants from claiming benefits for four years after arrival.  Net migration in the UK is running at well over 300,000 a year and that is not sustainable, he said. So we do need to find ways to allow member states to make changes to their social security systems that will help them to deal with this issue. He acknowledged that his proposal would be difficult for some member states to accept, but he stressed that it was not a threat to the principle of free movement to work. Romanians, alongside other Europeans, make a valuable contribution to the United Kingdom in a wide range of fields, from finance to science and medicine, he said. But it was never envisaged that free movement would trigger quite such vast numbers of people moving across our continent. This week Donald Tusk, the European Council president, said there was no consensus on Camerons demand on welfare reforms, which is proving the trickiest of his four requests to accommodate. It was subsequently reported by the FT that Brussels officials were considering whether the UK could be granted an emergency brake on overall migration if it could be proved that public services such as schools and hospitals were being put under undue pressure. Cameron is expected to make a final push at the EU summit to win agreement for his migrant welfare proposal in the hope that fellow leaders show more flexibility than officials who have dismissed it. UK government sources said Cameron wants to eyeball EU leaders before making a final decision on whether to compromise. The proposed four-year ban lies at the heart of his plan to win round UK voters before calling an EU referendum, which is due before the end of 2017.

Having played a key part in helping his nation qualify for their seventh consecutive Rugby World Cup, Catalin Fercu reluctantly decided he could not board the plane to New Zealand in 2011, explaining his fear of flying was too great. Some of his team-mates were dismayed and publicly angry. The eastern Europeans went on to endure their worst ever tournament, finishing bottom of their pool with no points and a -125 points deficit. Four years on, and Fercu told the Guardian that he still has moments when he does not want to get on a plane but with the World Cup in England (and Cardiff), he will not be denied this time around. In fact, the pacy full-back has had the least distance to travel of all of Romanias 2015 World Cup squad, as he is the only player that plies his trade with an English team, Saracens. Fercu has featured only fleetingly for the Premiership sides first team since his move in 2014 but, at 29 and with 80 international caps to his name, will no doubt be looking to make up for lost time. In a team that are notorious for having a ferocious pack, Fercus speed of foot and thought will aid Romanias backs if they decide to play more expansively. But in a pool containing France, Ireland, Italy and Canada, that is a dangerous business and even the Welsh head coach, Lynn Howells, admitted last year: The difficulty is that our best players are all forwards. The backs have some way to go, to be honest. Romania have competed at every World Cup since its inception in 1987, winning five matches, largely by keeping it tight in the front five and capitalising on errors  Florin Vlaicu is an excellent placekicker  while they themselves try to uphold a high standard of discipline. The props Mihai Lazar and Horatiu Pungea play in Frances Top 14 (for Castres and Oyonnax respectively), as does the second-row Valentin Ursache  the pack are a constant menace and continue to be the focal point in attack. Our point remains the forwards, says Fercu. But not just to rely on them because all the teams are well prepared. We have to play quality rugby. Lynn has told us to be confident. Confidence is certainly not lacking, especially after clinching their third IRB Nations Cup win in four years. Our objective is two wins, continues Fercu. We know that is difficult but not impossible. While many might back them to repeat last Novembers 18-9 win over Canada, it would be an incredible achievement to beat one of France, Ireland or Italy: a win that would ensure a third-placed finish in Pool D, which would give them automatic qualification for the 2019 World Cup in Japan. Michael Butler Howells, who was Waless assistant coach to Graham Henry during the 1999 World Cup, joined the Romania setup in 2012 but could leave after this years tournament, as his contract expires. The 65-year-old has few injury worries in his squad, only the South African-born Johann van Heerden is a slight doubt for their opener against France at the Olympic Stadium  he suffered a concussion on his Romania debut in the narrow 16-21 loss to Tonga earlier this month. Van Heerden is one of four players (alongside Paula Kinikinilau, Michael Wiringi and Otar Turashvili) who has qualified for The Oaks under the three-year residency rule but Howells has been keen to grow the countrys domestic talent. He is also director of rugby at the Bucharest Wolves  a development side assembled from eight Romanian clubs  that play in the European Rugby Challenge Cup. Ranked 17th in the world, Romania finished behind their fiercest rivals, Georgia, in the European Nations Cup (aka Six Nations B) to qualify for this years tournament. Captain Mihai Macovei, at 6ft 4in, leads the side  the 28-year-old can play either at flanker or at No8. Many of the squad are coming into their prime: just three of the 31 are younger than 23 or older than 32 and 11 have more than 50 international caps. The goal of two wins might be a stretch but Howells has plenty to be optimistic about.

A two-year investigation by the Environmental Investigation Agency US (EIA), an NGO, says it recorded officials from Holzindustrie Schweighofer offering to buy illegal timber from investigators posing as buyers and filmed unmarked logs dumped at the companys depots in apparent violation of Romanian law. Schweighofer is Romanias biggest producer of softwood, processing around 40% of the countrys annual production. Romanias vast and largely intact forests, which are home to bison, lynx and bears, have lost 280,000 hectares of forest during the last decade, according to satellite analyses, much of it to illegal logging. The EIA estimated that around half of all logging in Romania is illegal, based on government reports and local NGOs, and said that in the majority of illegal logging cases it uncovered, the wood ended up in Schweighofers supply chain. Schweighofer told the Guardian its officials had never said they accepted illegal wood and denied unmarked logs had entered its collection points or sawmills. The company has said it is committed to sustainably harvesting forests for timber, and that its forests are certified by the independent Forest Stewardship Council and the Programme for the Enforcement of Forest Certification. In several undercover meetings, email and phone conversations with the companys officials, EIA investigators posed as foreign investors who would be willing to overcut  a form of illegal logging where more trees are cut than a permit allows  and asked if the company would buy such wood. They say that more than one Schweighofer manager said yes on different occasions. The meetings were recorded on audio and video. Romanian tax records obtained by the NGO reveal that Schweighofer sourced from at least 1,000 different suppliers in 2014, which the EIA said was such a high number that extreme efforts would be required to exclude illegally sourced timber. The company has three sawmills and two factories in Romania. Investigators filmed piles of unmarked logs in northern Romania on a truck they had followed from a forest to which the claim is still being contested after it was restituted following the end of communist rule. The truck was seen going a train depot with a large sign at the entrance that said it was owned by Schweighofer, where the logs were seen loaded onto a train. Markings are the only way to tell if a log is from a legal source, the EIA said, and Romanian regulations require them on logs more than 20cm in diameter.  Just as the world is shutting the door on illegal timber trade, one of the worst and most powerful actors is operating directly within the heart of Europe, said Alexander von Bismark, executive director of EIA US. Its devastating for Europes last virgin forest and the communities that depend on them, but also for legitimate foresters throughout Europe. The Romanian government raided Schweighofers sawmill in Sebe earlier this year and has already publicly said it found accounting irregularities in the recording of timber quantities and sourcing, and that it suspected timber there was from illegal sources. The report produced by officials following the raid, which has not been published yet but has been seen by the Guardian, concludes that: We believe ... that these wood materials, having a total volume of 1,455.1 m3, recorded as inputs of HSR Sebes [Schweighofers sawmill], are not based on legal documents of origin. The result, the government report said, was a fictive origin which, on the downstream trade flow can lead to the creation of environments conducive to committing criminal and/or civil acts. The companys customers include DIY stores and wood pellet companies across Europe, in Romania, Austria, Italy, the Czech Republic and France. Among the companies are Italian energy giant Enels Romanian subsidiary, which the EIA said spent 9.9m with Schweighofer in 2014, and Spar Austria, the supermarket, which reportedly spent 3.3m that year. Bricostore Romania, a chain of DIY stores owned by the UK-based Kingfisher, which owns B&Q and has trumpeted its environmental credentials, spent 2.5m with Schweighofer, according to the EIA.  Enel said it had bought green certificates from Schweighofer for a biomass plant, but had not bought any wood from the company. A spokesperson from Brico Dpt Romania said: Brico Depot Romania is committed to responsibly sourced timber. Some timber from the company in question is sold in Brico Dpt Romanias stores and we are therefore very concerned about the issues raised. We are actively working with our suppliers here to ensure they adhere to our policy on responsibly sourced timber. We took action in February to suspend deliveries from the supplier following previous claims, and will be further investigating these allegations with them directly.  A spokeswoman for Spar said: We confronted Schweighofer with the problem and we have a written contract that they deliver us only legal wood. To ensure, we have the wood be tested by an quality assurance agency, which guarantees us that the wood we sell is certified with the FSC certificate. This is an international standard which we believe to trust. Responding to the EIA allegations, a Schweighofer spokeswoman said its officials comments had been taken out of context. Never, in any business discussion, HS [Holzindustrie Schweighofer] representatives said we accept illegal wood. Their statements were taken out of context, to leave the impression that they were flexible, but what they really said was that they accepted a higher volume. This is business as usual and it complies with all existing regulations. The first and foremost condition requested by HS from all its suppliers is the legal origin of the wood and the proper documents which prove this. If a supplier fails to respect this condition, the purchase is cancelled. The spokeswoman rejected the claim the company was sourcing unmarked logs: There is no log coming into the sawmills or the collecting points without documents or without the proper marking/stamp, she said."

I get to MBM Australia v Uruguay earlier, now another mismatch. A tier one team, these ranked number five in the world, against some no-hope chumps. Romania, ranked 17th in the world, trying to stave off wave after wave of attack from an Ireland side confident enough to make 12 changes from the side that eased past Canada a week ago. Seriously, editors, why the eff are you making me do this?</p> <p><strong>But wait, I<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>m being obviously disingenuous! </strong>OK, yes, Ireland will probably <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><80><9c> <em>probably</em> <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><80><9c> have too much for the Romanians today, but a walkover akin to this morning<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s is by no means guaranteed. Romania may be without the flanker Valentin Ursache, suspended for a dangerous tackle against France, but their grizzly set of forwards will be more than up for a bone-crunching battle with Ireland<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s gnarled and wizened pack.</p> <p><strong>France may have ended up with a comfortable-looking 38-11 win</strong> on Wednesday, but they didn<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>t have it all their own way. It was only when Romania were down to 14 men that they finally crossed the line and then added a gloss to the score with a bunch of late tries. And Ireland, for all their grunt, don<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>t have the same fizzing backs game as the French.</p> <p><strong>Still, you expect Ireland to have too much behind the scrum, </strong>even if Romania can match them up front. You expect Joe Schmidt<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s men to be too fit and to outlast Romania. You expect the four-day turnaround to prove costly to Romania as it was to Japan against Scotland.</p> <p><strong>That said, you expected South Africa to thrash Japan.</strong> You expected Italy to blow the cobwebs off and easily beat Canada. You expected Tonga<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s backs to be too much for Georgia. You expected the All Blacks to stop Namibia from scoring a try. <strike> You expected England to beat Wales at Twickenham. </strike> And, as I write this, the USA have just taken the lead against South Africa.</p> <p><strong>There has only been one earth-shattering shock in this World Cup so far*.</strong> But it has been a far from predictable tournament and Ireland, while they are probably going to win and do so reasonably comfortably, probably shouldn<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>t get too complacent.

Irelands second string get a good run out and put in a satisfying performance. The two wings, Earls and Bowe, both looked very good and theres a strong chance the latter has played his way back into the starting XV for France and Italy. Romania lost heavily but werent blown away and once again didnt look out of place at the World Cup. They can be more than proud of their performance today; they look like a side that could genuinely upset Italy. Thats all from me, folks. Thanks for reading, bye! Updated at 7.00pm BST  6.33pm BST Ireland get a penalty thanks to good work from OBrien in the tackle. Jackson quickly punts the ball into the corner. This should be the last move. Toner takes it, the maul forms, but Romania refuse to give in. Reddan goes inside to Bowe, but hes driven back away from the line as he looks for his hat-trick. Bowe holds on and Romania get the penalty. Its booted into touch and thats that.  6.31pm BST Kinikinilau takes over kicking duties and wont have an easier one than that.  6.30pm BST The throw goes too far, but Carpu recovers it well. The ball comes back inside and Tonita goes over the top of Jackson to score under the posts! Updated at 6.57pm BST  6.29pm BST 77 min The maul has little effect for Romania, so they shift it inside. Surugiu snipes round the short side and gets a penalty for side entry, so Vlaicu pops it into the corner.  6.28pm BST 76 min A chance for Romania now as Murray, out of position on the wing, allows it to bounce before catching the ball in his 22 and hes duly shunted into touch. Lineout 15 from the line.  6.27pm BST From just to the right, Madigan knocks it over easily.  6.26pm BST Into the corner it goes and Murphy takes the throw. The maul is far, far too powerful and its a very easy try, Chris Henry the man ending up with it. Updated at 6.37pm BST  6.25pm BST 73 min Ireland rumble up over halfway before Cave dummies and slips through a gap, getting up to the 22. Surugiu dives into the ruck and plays the ball, so Ireland get the penalty out on the right.  6.24pm BST 72 min Another good effort at the scrum from Romania, so Zebo kicks clear with little front foot ball to work with. Its returned by Fercu though and now Ireland can run it back.  6.24pm BST 71 min Bad news for Ireland: Kearney picked up a knock while scoring that try and has had to go off; Murray coming on in his place and going to the wing while Zebo returns to 15. Gal comes back from the sin-bin.  6.22pm BST 69 min Romania are still going as they surge from a scrum into the 22. Its knocked on by Carpo, who has put in a mighty shift at eight but is puffing like Don Draper now. Irish scrum on their own 22.  6.20pm BST 68 min Loads of changes for Romania, as they empty their bench. Lazar on for Ursache, Burcea for Macovei, Surugiu for Calafateanu and Vlaicu for Wiringi at 10.  6.19pm BST 67 min Wide on the left again  Ireland, like Australia earlier, are putting a lot of width on the ball today  and Madigans conversion drifts off to the left.  6.18pm BST Zebo gets some space after Reddan switches play from a centrefield scrum, and turns it on, sprinting clear and getting one-on-one with Fercu. Kearney is running the supporting line and Zebo pops it inside for the full-back to go over on the left. Updated at 6.33pm BST  6.16pm BST 64 min More changes as Kearney comes back on for Earls, Furlong replaces White and, because Joe Schmidt is a cruel man, he unleashes OConnell, coming on for Ryan.  6.15pm BST Another tough one for Madigan, on the right-hand touchline. He of the godawful hair gets it inside the far post very nicely though.  6.14pm BST A good push from Romania, but Ireland get it quickly into the backs. Jackson comes on the loop and flings it wide for Bowe to get his second in the corner and Ireland have the bonus point. Updated at 6.23pm BST  6.13pm BST Ireland take the scrum. Theyll be eager for that bonus point, given that France got one.  6.12pm BST 61 min Reddan spins it inside and Cave steps neatly past his man and through the line. Ireland get up to the line and have advantage; the ball goes wide and behind the three-quarter line, so we go back for an offside against Gal. Yellow card for the inside centre.  6.11pm BST 60 min High ball from Calafateanu and Jackson jumps to take it on halfway. Ionita, the replacement wing, chases and mistimes his tackle, catching the Ulsterman while hes still  just  in the air. It was very marginal, his foot was only just off the ground, so its a penalty only  very good call that by Craig Joubert. Cronin and OBrien replace Strauss and Heaslip, while Van Heerden comes on for Lucaci. Ireland get the lineout just inside the 22.  6.07pm BST 59 min Theres been a tiny momentum shift here and Romani are on the front foot, but again it goes loose and Ireland look to attack again. Bowe stabs through for Earls, but its too close to Botezatu and the wing fields it.   6.06pm BST 58 min Now it goes right and loose, so Botezatu hacks ahead. Zebo goes back and recovers; it goes back to Madigan on the back foot and he tries the cross kick to Earls, but it bounces into touch on halfway. Jackson comes on for Payne.  6.05pm BST 57 min Romania look to go from the lineout inside their own half, but Jordi Murphy steals it. Left they go, but Romania drift across and shut the move down.  6.04pm BST 56 min Earls comes back on having passed his head injury assessment. McGrath is on for Healy too. Were having another HIA though, as Radoi goes off and Turashvili takes his place.  6.03pm BST 55 min That was only cleared about 10 metres upfield, so Ireland get good position with the lineout. They maul it, but it goes infield and Carpo wins the turnover. Indeed he gets a penalty too, as Heaslip goes in at the side.  6.02pm BST 54 min Romania lineout then, five from their own line and they just about get the ball. Ive rarely heard a crowd this noisy and Ive been to Thomond Park. For Romania, Ionita replaces Apostol and Tarus comes on for Ion.  6.00pm BST 53 min Its a bit scrappy from Ireland and theres nothing on, so Reddan chips towards the corner. Apsotol goes back and collects, but his clearance is brilliantly charged by the flying Kearney.  5.59pm BST 52 min Ireland have the scrum a few metres inside the Romania half as McGrath prepares to come on, presumably for Healy.   5.59pm BST 51 min An exchange of kicks, neither of which is much cop, then Romania look to run it. Again Irelands defence is solid and Radoi then drops a pass from Calafateanu that was up above his head.  5.57pm BST 50 min Romania lineout then, on the right, 16 metres inside the Irish half. Kearney has gone to full-back and Zebo to the wing, by the way. Ireland pinch the lineout and Madigan looks to send a raking kick across the field to touch, but Fercu reads it and fields.  5.56pm BST 49 min Penalty to Romania when the Irish back row dont roll away from the tackle area on the 10 metre line. Theres an injury though, as Earls has taken an accidental knee to the head tackling Botezatu around the legs and will go off for an HIA. Rob Kearney is on in his place.  5.54pm BST 48 min Having cleared, Ireland win another turnover on halfway and Healy barrels through a tackle to make ground in midfield. Ireland go for the quick offloading game and theres a sense of inevitability when Healy knocks it forward. Romania look to go on the counter.  5.53pm BST 47 min Now it goes right and Apostol does well down the wing, handing Reddan off. They recycle, getting into the 22 and the number 14 has another little forage down that side. Hes looking dangerous, but hes well marked. After another three phases though, Ireland win the turnover and clear.  5.52pm BST 46 min Toner is again excellent at the restart and Reddan puts it up. Romania just about secure it on halfway though and shift it left, but Wiringi is isolated and driven backwards.  5.51pm BST From 15 metres in, Madigan slots the extras.  5.50pm BST From the back of the maul, Reddan dinks a very cute little grubber through towards the in-goal area behind the rush defence. Earls picks it up low to the floor and goes over in the left-hand corner. Updated at 5.59pm BST  5.49pm BST 43 min They go through the phases though, just outside the 22 but Heaslip wins the 22 and Healy (!!) kicks ahead for Earls to chase. Fercu gets back and fields it near his own line, but Earls chase is outstanding and the full-back can only find touch 10 metres out from his own line.  5.48pm BST 42 min Radois throw is well taken and Romania get clean ball off the top. Their backs are running from deep and struggling to break the gain line though.  5.47pm BST 41 min Here we go again, Madigan gets us restarted and his short kick is brilliantly taken by Toner, who storms straight up to the 22. They recycle, but theres a clearout round the neck by Henry and a penalty to Romania. Calafateanu kicks well to touch on the right, 40 metres upfield.  5.45pm BST Looking at Wembley, there are at least 25,000 people at the bar.  5.45pm BST We have a world record! It's a new #RWC RECORD CROWD at Wembley! 89,267 here - rough estimate at 87,000 being Irish fans #RWC2015 #IREvROM  5.43pm BST An email comes in! And its from a man simply called Jonny. I dont think its Sexton. Hello Mr. Dan, what a great start to the Ireland game its been. I was supposed to be there at Wembley today with my wife and kid but I lost my ticket in a poker game to my mate down the pub the other night. Hes there with them now. Im in a world of pain right now but your MBM is getting me through the pain caused by my gambling and alcohol addiction. Many thanks. Oh my.  5.41pm BST That was 40 minutes of Wayne Jarvis-esque professionalism from Ireland. Joe Schmidt wont be happy with a couple of turnovers, perfectionist that he is, and they probably will have wanted one more try before the break, but another half like that and theyll be as satisfied as a man who has just eaten a massive steak and washed it down with a couple of glasses of Lagavulin.  5.31pm BST Its advantage Ireland at the scrum for an illegal pass, but they wont need it as Madigans cross-chip is fielded by Bowe and offloaded back inside to Zebo, who is just scragged. Thats a great take, but when it comes back inside Madigan overcooks his pass to Healy and the prop knocks on.  5.29pm BST 39 min Ireland scrum, five metres infield and just over the Romanian 10 metre line.  5.28pm BST 38 min Earls fields Calafateanus clearance and gives it to Zebo. Hes turned over by an outstanding counterrruck, but then, having secured possession, its lost forward on the floor by a Romanian player. Updated at 5.39pm BST  5.28pm BST 37 min Its thrown to the back, but Romania defend the maul brilliantly. Down it goes and they get the turnover and scrum. Carpo gets pats on the back for his work in tying the ball up there and deservedly so. Paul Devlin asks: As a seasoned rugby reporter, perhaps you can enlighten me as to when the rules were changed. It was always the case that the forward pass was outlawed. Now however it seems to be a legitimate move. One Romania surge just past featured not one, but two forward passes out of three. A bit like watching gridiron with 15 quarterbacks. Its going to take me too long to respond in full, but its essentially down to the direction the hands are pointing in and momentum of a player going forward.  5.26pm BST 36 min Carpo then goes offside at the lineout though and its a penalty to Ireland. Madigan opts for touch again, giving his side a lineout eight metres from the line, on the right.  5.25pm BST 35 min Its a strong scrum from Ireland and Romania buckle, but Carpo picks up well at the base. Calafateanu picks up and box kicks clear off the back foot, making good ground too as he gets it to touch beyond the 10 metre line.  5.23pm BST 34 min The move comes to an end when Healy  who is back up  knocks on in the double tackle. Ah, and now hes down hurt again after that.  5.22pm BST 33 min Bad news for Ireland as Healy is down having treatment. Ireland continue to pick and drive, but Romania are knocking them back now as we go into the 12th phase.  5.21pm BST 32 min Ireland show Geoff Parling how its done and throw to the back of the lineout, where Toner takes. They go for the pick and drive, looking to suck Romanian defenders in.  5.20pm BST 31 min Penalty Ireland as Bowe is taken out in the air going for a high ball. Madigan sticks it into touch just outside the Romanian 22.  5.19pm BST 30 min From the left touchline this time, Madigan strikes the near post.  5.18pm BST Oh what a pass this is from Zebo! With Ireland simply crabbing back and forth across the pitch, he whips a beauty of a pass off his right, looping it over the top and wide for Earls to go speeding over from the 22. Updated at 5.29pm BST  5.17pm BST 28 min Ireland go left off the lineout, then back right, but its pretty slow stuff.  5.17pm BST 27 min Henry steals the lineout, tapping it back and Ireland can attack from halfway. Madigan stabs a low kick through and a nasty bounce sees it fly up over Fercus head. He goes back and takes it, but then decides to run and is wrapped up. Calafateanu clears down the left, but barely gets it out the 22.  5.15pm BST 26 min This time Madigan sticks it in the corner, buoyed by that alst maul. They dont get to form one this time though, as Heaslip is penalised for obstruction and Romania clear to touch.  5.14pm BST 25 min Toner takes it and here comes that Irish driving maul. The Romania pack splinters and they walk to within 10 before the penalty is given. It;s against the number eight Carpo, for entering at the side.  5.13pm BST 24 min Oof. Payne gets smashed by Tonita, but the lock was up far too quickly and is pinged for offisde. Madigan goes to touch again, on the left, this time on the 22.  5.12pm BST 23 min And now its a penalty against Radoi, as Henry completely stitches him up in the tackle and forces the hooker to hold on. Madigan to touch on the left, on Irelands 10 metre line.  5.11pm BST 22 min Good from Fercu, chasing and catching his own high kick in midfield. They look to get it through the hands, but theres a touch of hesitation and a shortage of ideas among the backs. It goes right and Kinikinilau takes it up to within 10 metres, but ignores an overlap on his right!  5.10pm BST Madigans kick from the touchline is excellent, drifting perfectly inside the near post.  5.09pm BST Brilliant from Earls, regathering a high box kick close to the touchline and spinning back inside. He offloads and Ireland sweep the ball right across the pitch. It comes to Bowe, who shows great strength to stay infield and ground it in the right-hand corner as Fercu looks to tackle him into touch. Updated at 5.15pm BST  5.06pm BST From 15 metres in and 27 out, Madigan curls it over.  5.06pm BST 17 min It comes inside then back out from the lineout and Earls makes ground, pumping the legs and pushing the tackler back. They go through the phases, sweeping right across the field and getting over the gain line. Theres a clearout around the neck earlier in the move though and so, when it breaks down, we go back for the penalty.  5.04pm BST 16 min From the lineout, Calafateanu box kicks clear to the 10 metre line.  5.04pm BST 15 min Wiringi gives it short to Kinikinilau and he barrels into contact down the left. Its back inside to Fercu, but he loses the ball in contact and, when it goes left, Zebo comes away at pace. It goes back inside, then out again and Zebo is put away by Strauss after a great offload from Earls. He kicks ahead and regathers magnificently, with zero space, to go over in the corner for what looks like a stunning try. Endless tedious TMO replays eventually show that he had a foot millimetres in touch though. Updated at 5.12pm BST  5.00pm BST 13 min Mistake from Wiringi as, after the lineout, he stabs his flat kick straight into the arms of Zebo. Ireland get it to Madigan, who looks for the corner but his kick is half charged down and now Romania have it inside the Irish half.  4.59pm BST 12 min Credit has to go to Romania for that patient, well-disciplined comeback after not seeing the ball for four minutes. Ireland put width on it from the restart, but when Payne loops round the outside of Earls he runs out of space and is taken into touch by Lucaci.  4.58pm BST From wide on the left  16 metres infield  and just outside the 22, the scrum-half brings his kick around and inside the far post.  4.57pm BST 10 min Now its Romanias chance to pile on the crash balls, before the Saracen Fercu looks to wriggle his way through. He cant, but then Payne doesnt roll out of the tackle and its a chance to level the scores.  4.56pm BST 9 min Wiringi, the Kiwi-born fly-half, restarts with a short kick. Its gathered in, but a mistake from Reddan who puts his box kick out on the full from tight to his left touchline, 15 metres inside his own half.  4.55pm BST Straight through it goes and Ireland have something to show for their strong start. Updated at 5.14pm BST  4.54pm BST 7 min From the lineout, Calafateanu sends it high and hte ball bounces back to Kinikinilau. He runs into the tackle from Strauss, then Macovei, the captain, goes off his feet at the ruck. Kinikinilau was holding on too, so Madigan will have a shot at goal from 40 metres, dead in front.  4.53pm BST 6 min Gal, the inside centre, tries to gain territory with a tactical grubber kick, but its a poor one and Bowe fields easily. The wing threads it down the line, into touch just outside the 22.  4.52pm BST 5 min Its a relentless start from Ireland and you wonder how long that Romanian defence can resist. Its already a thumpingly physical start, although Strauss coughs the ball up as he cant quite clutch on to a cute offload from Ryan inside the 22.  4.51pm BST 4 min After three minutes, Romania get their hands on the ball as Ireland knock on in the tight. Calefateanu thumps the clearance to touch and Ireland come again from the lineout, 40 metres away from the line.  4.50pm BST 3 min Now Ireland make ground as Earls comes infield and gets it to Payne outside him. Into the 22 and they look to build, going through the phases 10 metres or so out in midfield.  4.49pm BST 2 min Madigan sends up a high one and its tapped back to Payne from the Romania 22. Bowe looks to wriggle free, but Romanias defence is up quickly and hitting the tackles hard. Updated at 4.59pm BST  4.48pm BST Peep! Craig Joubert blows his whistle and Romania, playing today in white with a black stripe down the middle, get things start. Ireland carry up towards the halfway line, with Cave stepping inside and making a break.  4.46pm BST Wait, I didnt think that game through. Luckily, the rugby is about to get under way!  4.46pm BST Anyone want to play a game? Its called What the hell is Paloma Faith choking on when she sings the word union?  4.44pm BST Its another sell-out at Wembley, with 90,000-odd fans in there. Most of them supporting Ireland, you wont be surprised to know. 89,019 is the record, set at this ground a week ago when New Zealand played Argentina. This could run it close. Updated at 4.58pm BST  4.38pm BST We have some thoughts! They are these: @DanLucas86 Bowe & Earls will want 2 put in big shifts & plenty of quick ball, need 2 put 30-40+ on Romania, have 2 b clinical & disciplined On the telly, Joe Schmidt says they intend to give Cian Healy 50 or 60 minutes today.  4.36pm BST 29 years and 245 days. Thats the average age of the Ireland XV  their oldest in World Cup history. There have been stories going around, including on here, that its the oldest in World Cup history, although Im pretty sure this Romanian side is older.  4.33pm BST So how are you feeling, Ireland fans? Id be pretty confident about their chances. This line up actually shows one of their great strengths: this is very much a second string team but, half-backs aside, you wouldnt say that it was that much weaker than the first team.  4.24pm BST Time for some pre-match reading. Paul Rees has had a chat with a Usain Bolt-inspired Simon Zebo.  Related: Irelands Simon Zebo inspired by Usain Bolt as team prepare to play Romania | Kevin Mitchell   4.13pm BST You can catch the last five minutes of Scotland v USA with Michael Butler, right here. Spoiler alert: Scotland are going to win it.  2.26pm BST Afternoon, folks. Oh great, another one of these. I get to MBM Australia v Uruguay earlier, now another mismatch. A tier one team, these ranked number five in the world, against some no-hope chumps. Romania, ranked 17th in the world, trying to stave off wave after wave of attack from an Ireland side confident enough to make 12 changes from the side that eased past Canada a week ago. Seriously, editors, why the eff are you making me do this? But wait, Im being obviously disingenuous! OK, yes, Ireland will probably  probably  have too much for the Romanians today, but a walkover akin to this mornings is by no means guaranteed. Romania may be without the flanker Valentin Ursache, suspended for a dangerous tackle against France, but their grizzly set of forwards will be more than up for a bone-crunching battle with Irelands gnarled and wizened pack. France may have ended up with a comfortable-looking 38-11 win on Wednesday, but they didnt have it all their own way. It was only when Romania were down to 14 men that they finally crossed the line and then added a gloss to the score with a bunch of late tries. And Ireland, for all their grunt, dont have the same fizzing backs game as the French. Still, you expect Ireland to have too much behind the scrum, even if Romania can match them up front. You expect Joe Schmidts men to be too fit and to outlast Romania. You expect the four-day turnaround to prove costly to Romania as it was to Japan against Scotland. That said, you expected South Africa to thrash Japan. You expected Italy to blow the cobwebs off and easily beat Canada. You expected Tongas backs to be too much for Georgia. You expected the All Blacks to stop Namibia from scoring a try.  You expected England to beat Wales at Twickenham.  And, as I write this, the USA have just taken the lead against South Africa. There has only been one earth-shattering shock in this World Cup so far*. But it has been a far from predictable tournament and Ireland, while they are probably going to win and do so reasonably comfortably, probably shouldnt get too complacent. People called Romanians they wont go the house quietly. Kick-off is at 4.45pm BST. Thats 6.45pm for those of you in Bucharest. Your teams are: Simon Zebo; Tommy Bowe, Jared Payne, Darren Cave, Keith Earls; Ian Madigan, Eoin Reddan; Cian Healy, Richardt Strauss, Nathan White; Donnacha Ryan, Devin Toner; Jordi Murphy, Chris Henry, Jamie Heaslip (capt).Replacements: Sean Cronin, Jack McGrath, Tadhg Furlong, Paul OConnell, Sean OBrien, Conor Murray, Paddy Jackson, Rob Kearney.

But, certainly in the first half, they were a mess and they did not really get it going terribly well in the second either. Having said that, this was a team with 13 changes from that one that faced Italy, so perhaps that rustiness can be excused as they learned how to operate with one another.

And they did. But, certainly in the first half, they were a mess and they did not really get it going terribly well in the second either. Having said that, this was a team with 13 changes from that one that faced Italy, so perhaps that rustiness can be excused as they learned how to operate with one another. They can argue that they got the job done too: a win and a bonus point sets them up very nicely in Pool D.  Romania will be delighted by their try and their grunt in the first half. They had a few flashes it will be interesting to see how they play against Italy: they could well give them a game. Thanks for reading, Im off. Updated at 10.03pm BST  9.49pm BST France have suddenly woken up, first La Roux, then Guitoune burst up the pitch as they seek another try. Its a bit late for that now. And with that, Peyper puts this out of its misery.  9.48pm BST 78 min: Quick ball from a French lineout on the Romania 22 works its way at speed to Fickou, he steps inside catching the entire Romania line off guard and he nips through to score under the posts. For a team that havent been on form, France can be pretty chuffed with the scoreline. Updated at 9.55pm BST  9.43pm BST 75 min: Guitoune is denied a hat-trick. He races up the left wing, chips the ball over the try line then catches it on the bounce. But he is unable to fully touch the ball down as he struggles not to go over the deadball line. Unlucky, hes had a good game in the midst of a patchy French display tonight.  9.41pm BST 74 min: Hang on: where did that come from? Romania kick a penalty to touch in the corner and as France pack the middle of the lineout, expecting Romania to drive through from there, a small raiding party peel off the front and whizz over the tryline. Updated at 10.01pm BST  9.38pm BST 72 min: Well, if Romania werent done and dusted already, they are now. France, though, are slightly flattered by this scoreline. They have not been at their best and can probably expect some more hot talk from Saint-Andre in the changing room afterwards.  9.36pm BST 70 min: Kockott replaces Parra for France, and his impact is immediate. He sets up an attack from which Dulin can offload to Fofana, who bumps and bursts his way over the tryline. No doubt about him grounding that one. France are scoring tries in bursts tonight, and will be delighted to have got the bonus point. Kockott takes over kicking duties too, and places the conversion through the posts. Updated at 9.44pm BST  9.33pm BST 68 min: It looks as if Guitoune is stopped short, then gets the ball over the line with a double, it not triple movement. Not that the TMO cares. He gives the try. Parra slots another conversion over. Possibly a contentious one there. Updated at 9.40pm BST  9.31pm BST 66 min: Is this a try? France run again from the back of a scrum, but after some slick interplay, Parra gets caught. Hes up to the Romania 22 and the forwards take over. They batter their way a few yards forward and then France spread the ball out to the right wing. Guitoune, from 10 yards out, wriggles and writhes his way to the line. He thinks hes over. Peyper doesnt and goes to the TMO.  9.28pm BST 63 min: Being honest, this is not a game featuring much in the way of quality. Still, France are trying to run it now. They break up the right but get held back. Then break up the left, offloading willy nilly for the first time in the match. Parra attempts to play Fofana in down the blindside but the ball goes down and thats the end of that brief surge.  9.25pm BST 60 min: Turashvilli rumbles off, Andrei Radoi replaces him at hooker for Romania. Romania get on the front foot and for a moment Ursache then Van Heerden look as though they are going to break through the French line. But France win the ball back and find a halfway line touch.  9.22pm BST 58 min: They blow it though. From the maul after the lineout, two players run into each other and Peyper blows up for a Romania penalty for obstruction, which is wellied well up the pitch.  9.21pm BST 56 min: Finally France do a bit or running and would do well to take notice of the fact that it works: in various fits and bursts they get to the Romania 22. Parra passes to Fickou, who darts into a tackle, and France ruck and maul it forwards now. Mas goes now but the referee brings the ball back for a penalty. From in front of the posts, France kick for touch as they look for tries for a bonus point. Updated at 9.32pm BST  9.18pm BST 53 min: Romania lose their own lineout on the 22 and France hoof long. After a bit of gadding about, Romania kick it back at them. So France kick it back. Theres another maul, then Romania kick it back. Its not a wonderful game, this.  9.16pm BST 52 min: Theres more shoddy handling in the French backs, the ball just not going to hands, their moves breaking down. They look out of touch and rusty, to be honest. Romania win a scrum, which turns and the penalty goes against the French.  9.15pm BST 50 min: Parra lofts a ball over the try line but Fercu gets across to, just about, make the ball safe. There is some grumbling in the French centre that they were blocked by some Romanian arms from running through and claiming Parras chip. The ref tells them he saw nothing. Updated at 9.24pm BST  9.13pm BST 49 min: Vlaicu is now playing fly half for Romania, and his team work through a series of phases but keep getting knocked back. They eventually conceded a penalty and, to a cheer, France kick for touch rather than for goal. Keyser, Mas and Chouly come on for France, Szarzewski, Antonio and Picamoles trot off. Updated at 9.18pm BST  9.10pm BST 46 min: From a promising position on the French 22, the ball pops forward from a Romanian hand - Turashvilli, I think - and France are happy to welly the ball long down the pitch. From the lineout, its Frances turn to drive the Romanian pack. They run the ball, throwing it wide down the left but no one in the French backline is willing to take a risk and cut inside to break the Romania line. The Romania fly half Dumbrava is hooked, Csaba Ga replaces him. Dumbrava is unchuffed.  9.06pm BST 43 min: The France scrum are not going to accept being shoved about quite so much here, so Romania get the ball out quickly and chuck it around a bit. They drive forwards and over the 22, but France are not overcommitting men to the mauls so as to have more defensive cover.   9.03pm BST The second half is under way: The French are still looking sheepish, Saint-Andr is still looking furious in his little booth. Romania get us going and a certain amount of kick tennis ensues. It ends with a scrum to Romania in the middle of the pitch, 30 metres from the France line. A good position from which to attack.  8.58pm BST A stat for you: 0 - #FRA have never lost a @rugbyworldcup game in which they have led by more than one point at half-time. Confident.  8.58pm BST I say they will be relieved to be in the dressing room, but thats before I saw camera footage of Saint-Andre going absolutely bananas at his team. Hes standing in the middle of the dressing room, waving his hands, and screaming his head off. His team are all looking sheepishly at their feet.  8.55pm BST France will be a lot more relieved than they might have been. For half an hour, they were in danger of being ground down by Romania. But those two quick tries have put them back to where they would have expected to be. Paulicas period in the sin bin has allowed them to find a route back into the game and the Romanian prop owes his team a performance to make up for it in the second half.  8.48pm BST Thatll be that for the first half. France have shone in patches, Romania have threatened in patches but the sin-binning scuppered them badly. See you in a few minutes.  8.46pm BST 40 min: No mistake this time. Romanias record Test points scorer gets another three for his tally. Updated at 8.46pm BST  8.45pm BST 39 min: Romania are awarded a penalty 30 metres out, in the middle of the pitch. Vlaicu will kick for goal. Heres Nyangas try, incidentally: Nyanga finishes off slick French move on right for second try - brought to you by @SamsungUK | #SamsungRugby http://t.co/2g6qxlfpuq  8.44pm BST 37 min: But then again  Romania are not done and dusted. They break up the left wing through Kinikinilau, he passes the ball inside to Fercu who is nailed before he can sprint to the line. But that was dangerous for France and they shouldnt switch off yet.  8.43pm BST 35 min: France are all over this match now, making full advantage of Romania being a man down. They run the ball from defence but a knock-on denies them the chance to open Romania up again.  8.40pm BST 33 min: Guitoune is caught on his halfway line, but he passes to Dulin who races forward. He sets up a platform for the French and they swing it out to the right wing. Apostel steps up and is done by a quick dummy, allowing Nyanga to charge into the same corner as Guitonne and score. Parra makes no mistake again. Updated at 9.07pm BST  8.37pm BST 30 min: Parra sends all the backs one way, and then throws the ball the other to Guitoune who dives over the line from a five yards out. That will be a relief to France who were beginning to sweat. Parra whistles the ball over from the touchline for the conversion, though not without it wobbling first one side of the upright and then the other in the breeze. Updated at 8.43pm BST  8.35pm BST 29 min: Paulica Ion is responsible for a scrum collapsing, and Peyper raises his hand high in the air. Penalty to France and they kick long into touch in the Romania 22. They finally win a lineout properly and then drive a maul furiously for the line. When the ball breaks free, Tales tries to chip the ball through the line but Dumbrava clears up. No matter, Peyper calls play back as he has spotted Paulica up to no good in the maul. Hell get a 10 minute breather in the sin bin for his troubles.  8.32pm BST 26 min: Theres something going on in the France rucks and mauls, Romania have won five turnovers already. Heres that boot to Szazewskis head, incidentally. Szarzewski forced off with injury after accidental boot in the face - brought to you by @SamsungUK | #SamsungRugby http://t.co/zby1fwN3n5  8.30pm BST 25 min: With a penalty in the bank, Dumbrava goes for a drop goal from somewhere several miles from the posts. He may as well, I suppose. He gets nowt from it and so Romania take the penalty from in front of the posts and 35 metres out. Vlaicu takes aim and misses by a distance.  8.27pm BST 22 min: The hooker Szarzewskis taken a blow to the face. Hell have to come off for a bit after getting a couple of studs to the head. Kayser comes on as a blood sub.  8.26pm BST 21 min: Romania win another French lineout and fling the ball wide. Apostol on the left wing roars up the touchline, then chips the ball ahead. France then have the chance to run it straight back, but Parra flings the ball across the 22 and France kick instead. Probably should have run that.  8.24pm BST Vlaicu picks up three points instead of the seven he was after. But Romania deserve to be level. Updated at 8.30pm BST  8.23pm BST 19 min: It looks a lot like Vlaicu has not got the ball down and was held up by Le Roux. The TMO agrees, saying no clear evidence the ball has touched the ground. Still, Romania have penalty in front of the posts in front of the posts in their back pocket, so they will settle for that.  8.21pm BST 18 min: Its a good decision too: the Romania pack are heaving, heaving and heaving towards the line. Lazar has a shove for the line, then Romania swing the ball wide and Vlaicu goes over! Inevitably Peyper goes upstairs   8.20pm BST 17 min: Romania run from the lineout, and Kinikinilau (I think) whelps a grubber through the French lines. France are under all sorts of pressure, and scrabble to deal with things. Dulin struggles to, and Romania again turn the ball and win a penalty. Theyre well in range of a penalty kick, but elect to kick for touch and drive for the try - to a great roar of approval from the crowd.  8.18pm BST 15 min: Macovei rises immaculately to claim the ball against the head from the lineout, then Romania hoof it straight into touch after the ball is passed back into the 22 and the French have another lineout in the Romanian Flanquart runs, but is chopped down and Romania turn the ball over, win a penalty and hoof for touch. Cautiously attritional are the best words for this so far.  8.16pm BST 14 min: France roll a maul forwards from the lineout, but have a penalty in the bag after from Romanian indiscipline. They kick for touch.  8.15pm BST 12 min: Scrum on the halfway line, and theres more chaos in the French front row as Lazar shoves Antonio about the place. The scrum is retaken and Romania are in charge once again, but it turns too far and France are given the push in. France dig in against the Romanians power and Picamoles takes quick ball out of the back. A high kick goes up, which is marked in the Romanian 22 and cleared well.  8.12pm BST 9 min: Flanquart makes a hash of claiming the kick-off and Romania steal possession. They start flinging it about, but a loose chip over the top is mopped up by Dulin and France clear up the pitch.  8.10pm BST So Parra slots the penalty over instead. Updated at 8.18pm BST  8.10pm BST 7 min: Nakaitaci comes off the back of the lineout with the ball at pace and France probe for the line. Romania get themselves offside twice, giving France the advantage. Parra knows it, so chips for the corner, safe in the knowledge that if it doesnt pay off they have a kick in front of the posts in the bag. It doesnt come off.   8.08pm BST 6 min: France keep running it, throwing the ball wide. Romania are concerned that the French have too much pace for them, so they have pressed right up to stop them getting through. But it means they concede a penalty for obstruction, which France kick to touch. French lineout on the Romania 22.  8.07pm BST 5 min: A big up and under from Fercu is claimed by Fickou and he is subsequently mobbed. The maul collapses, and the ref blows up, giving the scrum put in to France. Will be exciting to see what the Romanian packs does here  the answer is not quite so much damage but some. France run the ball.  8.05pm BST 3 min: Interesting: the Romania pack has substantially overpowered the French one there. The France scrum goes down and the Romanian pack celebrate like theyve just scored a try. This is going to be a battle of French backs v Romanian forwards. Updated at 8.29pm BST  8.04pm BST 2 min: Romania kick long and the France wing Nakaitaci claims. He races forwards and attempts to chip the Romanian defence. He doesnt get enough on the ball though and Romania can mop it up with ease.  8.03pm BST Were off: Jaco Peyper blows his whistle to get us underway and manages not to consult the TMO over it. Tales kicks off, Romania in yellow claim and scrum half Surugiu clears the ball to the halfway line.   8.00pm BST Corbyn-watch: most of the French sing their anthem, and do so reasonably tunefully. For rugby players. The Romanians are virtually all giving it some proper gusto though. 1-0 to the men from Eastern Europe.  7.57pm BST Here come the teams. They march down the tunnel to some dramatic music. No pyro though. Which is a good thing. Anthems ahoy!  7.56pm BST Meanwhile, Owen Gibson is back is his old Olympic stomping ground. This is what it looks like inside the stadium: Here's the view from the back tier. I'll stop now. pic.twitter.com/GKf1BNhldj  7.55pm BST Expect France to attempt to outpace Romania, theres plenty of speed in their side tonight. We lined up a team that will look to move the ball and provide some momentum, the France backs coach Patrice Lagisquet said. We hope that this game plan will be easier to implement than against Italy, where there were loads of interruptions. Will it mean a game of free-flowing, running rugby? Or will Romania smother them?  7.47pm BST The France coach Philippe Saint-Andr is chit chatting before the match. He says his team need to be patient, and that all 13 players he has brought in can make a point to him about getting in the starting lineup against Ireland. Hes reasonably unimpressed by the Olympic Stadium though. To be honest, I came here for the Olympics, he shrugs.  7.35pm BST France are coming into this match on the back of three wins on the trot - against England, Scotland and Italy. Romania are arriving on the back of defeats to Tonga, Edinburgh and a 10-10 draw with Leeds Carnegie. So it seems likely that there is only one way this match is going to go. Theyre playing at the Olympic Stadium, which looks absolutely cavernous this evening. It also looks remarkably good filled with rugby posts, soperhaps its time for a rethink on its future occupants. Do Quins fancy moving in?  7.18pm BST Before we get to France v Romania, theres some hot breaking news for Argentina (and Gloucester, to some degree), which Ive lifted directly from PA: Argentina lock Mariano Galarza has received a nine-week ban and will miss the remainder of the World Cup. Galarza was cited for making contact with the eye or eye area of New Zealand forward Brodie Retallick during last Sundays Pool C game between the countries at Wembley. In a statement, Rugby World Cup Limited said: Galarza denied the act of foul play. Having conducted a detailed review of all the available evidence, including all camera angles and additional evidence, including from Retallick, the player and submissions from his representatives, the judicial officer Christopher Quinlan QC upheld the citing on the basis that the player had committed the act of foul play. With respect to the sanction, the judicial officer deemed the act of foul play merited a low-end entry point of 12 weeks. Due to the need to deter such acts of foul play, he added an additional period of one week. However, taking into account mitigating factors including his excellent disciplinary record, the judicial officer reduced the suspension to a period of nine weeks. Galarzas ban takes effect immediately, and he cannot play again until November 26. That means the Gloucester forward will miss part of his clubs campaign as his suspension does not expire until more than three weeks after the World Cup final. Galarza has 48 hours in which to appeal once he has received the written decision.  7.06pm BST France: 15. Brice Dulin; 14. Sofiane Guitoune, 13. Gal Fickou, 12. Wesley Fofana, 11. Noa Nakaitaci; 10.

In the 20 years between 1960 and 1980, Romania were a problem for the French and beat them six times in 22 Tests. Back then, Romania were strong with the communist government keen to fund the sport. But what politics gave it also took away, and a side that beat France, Wales and Scotland in the 80s was decimated in 1989 by the revolution in Romania. Five players died in the fighting, then money got so tight that kits, balls, facilities and grounds became unaffordable. The sport fell off a cliff and its been 25 years since Romania last worried France. Andy Bull tells the full tale here. This is the 50th Test between the two sides and the first since 2006, when France won 62-14. And Romania are going for it: their starting XV is experience, featuring 648 caps and is largely the same team that lost 21-16 to Tonga in their last warm-up match. They will be all about the grunt up front, their powerful pack their key weapon. But they do feature Saracens Catalin Fercu at full back. Arguably the most talented member of their team, he missed the 2011 tournament because he was too scared of flying to get on the plane. Something that did not amuse his friends. But if Romania are all about the experience, France are about youth. They have made 13 changes to the side that beat Italy on Saturday and with an average age of 28, this is the youngest side to represent France in eight years. A second win would put them firmly on course for qualification from Pool D, while a bonus point would be very welcome while theyre at it. Updated at 7.02pm BST"

Did we want a room in the old wooden house in the garden, or one in the new, more substantial, concrete house? We chose the concrete house because we could look at the wooden house from our balcony. There was traditional Maramures music playing, but on CD. It was incessantly jaunty. Our hostess, Marioara, soothed us with excellent homemade delicacies. Next day we set out walking. The wooden churches of the area were a big reason to come here, but the first we came to was of concrete. A conversation with an old basket maker was abruptly terminated by three Italian tourists who stepped between us, taking pictures.</p> <p>We wandered on, a little disconcerted, towards the village of Hoteni.

We ate our lunch in the shade of a walnut tree. My wife Sophie and daughter Maddy headed back to Breb while I made a detour, up a hill to where two men, both named Vasile, were loading hay on a horse-drawn cart. One of them spoke French.

People say that if you want old Europe, a place steeped in the rhythms of nature and skills lost elsewhere, then Romanias Maramures region is for you. Guidebooks talk of medieval isolation and ways of life unchanged since the third century AD. And then there was William Blackers sublime 2009 book The Enchanted Way which cast a deeply romantic glow over the entire place. No wonder we were fired up with great expectations. So when we began to see the villages, there was some consternation. Yes, there were a lot of traditional wooden houses with great square ornamental gateways and barns where homemade haymaking tools were leaning. But there were other buildings too: block-built houses with ugly balconies and UPVC windows. These did not fit. Nor did the old man in a Chelsea football shirt. Expectations are vital in the travel trade and ours were not being met, not yet at least. We reached the village of Breb and checked in at Pensiunea Marioara (doubles from 33 B&B). Did we want a room in the old wooden house in the garden, or one in the new, more substantial, concrete house? We chose the concrete house because we could look at the wooden house from our balcony. There was traditional Maramures music playing, but on CD. It was incessantly jaunty. Our hostess, Marioara, soothed us with excellent homemade delicacies. Next day we set out walking. The wooden churches of the area were a big reason to come here, but the first we came to was of concrete. A conversation with an old basket maker was abruptly terminated by three Italian tourists who stepped between us, taking pictures. We wandered on, a little disconcerted, towards the village of Hoteni. The plum trees were laden with fruit and the freshly cut meadows were speckled with stooks. At the church I watched a man remove his straw hat  the oddly conical be-ribboned traditional Maramures one  and cross himself as he passed. Nearby, the road was being rebuilt and there were traffic lights and growling lorries: we cut away across country, following any path we could find. An eagle soared. We ate our lunch in the shade of a walnut tree. My wife Sophie and daughter Maddy headed back to Breb while I made a detour, up a hill to where two men, both named Vasile, were loading hay on a horse-drawn cart. One of them spoke French. I had a go at forking hay, but the older Vasile soon took the tool back. Theres rain coming, well have to be quicker. A few minutes later I found myself sitting on top of the wagon, lurching down secret back roads to his house where I was taught how to stook and rewarded with a tot of homemade spirits. Where was the wooden church, I asked? Vasile showed me a path and along it I met another man, also called Vasile. My journey was interrupted with a trip to his house where I drank from his well. At the church I watched woodpeckers attacking the steeple, then wandered on, coming across an old man in a traditional smock, negotiating the price of a football-sized cheese with a man on horseback. I walked with him to his house and found his grandson helping to re-shingle the roof. Where are you going? he asked. It turned out he was on holiday from a job in London. Is your name Vasile? I asked. It was, and it was his grandfathers name too. Maramures has changed a lot, he said, People have gone abroad and made money and now are building new houses. But this Vasile, only 28 years old, had a view on that. It all happened very fast, but now we are realising that we have to value the old and traditional too. Im rebuilding my grandfathers house, but I wont change a thing  it will be all traditional, exactly like a century ago. He showed me inside, the two rooms hung with embroidered hangings and the roof studded with cooking pots. Back outside the 89-year-old was helping his 86-year-old wife dig out a ditch. When I asked for a photograph, she screeched in alarm and disappeared, only to reappear with a fresh headscarf, You cant photograph me in that old thing. They stay young by working, said the younger Vasile. They dont retire or watch television. When I got back to Breb, Sophie and Maddy reported similar experiences: helping an old lady mash pears and plums ready for brandy-making and watching others spin wool with distaffs. Maramures, we concluded, still has enchantments and a few parts of life may be unchanged since medieval times, but not all. The next day we drove right up the valley heading east, and took the Mocnia, a steam railway starting from Viseu de Sus. The line was built in 1932 and run primarily for logging operations in the remote mountain forests on the Ukraine border. Tourists, however, now provide a big subsidiary income. The train lurched and shuddered up the gorge of the river Vaser in a charmingly random fashion, 22km up to a logging station, Paltin, where we had lunch and walked for an hour in one of Europes most remote forests. Back at the locomotive I chatted to our driver, Dumitru Brendea. There is nowhere better than Maramures, he said. And the culture, I wondered, did he love it? Yes. And the music?

Street protests this week were merely the culmination of months of pressure triggered by a fraud and corruption case against him. Ponta is not alone. A slew of politicians, mayors, judges and prosecutors have been targeted in an anti-corruption drive quite unlike any other in eastern Europe  or the world for that matter. And it is a quiet, unassuming chief prosecutor, Laura Codrua Kvesi, who is bringing in the scalps. Before 2005, Romanian justice was not independent, says Kvesi, 42, in an interview given before Pontas resignation. This is why there was not enough courage to open complex investigations against high-level officials.  Related: Bucharest nightclub fire: Romania's PM and government resign after protests  A specialist anti-corruption agency, known by the acronym DNA, was founded in 2003, and it took a few years for it to narrow its focus on high-level graft  cases involving more than 10,000 (7,000)  and for it to start bringing successful prosecutions.  Nowadays there are 120 prosecutors working on more than 6,000 cases. The entrance to the DNAs central Bucharest offices is permanently staked out by television news crews waiting to see who will turn up next for questioning.  Last year the agency successfully prosecuted 24 mayors, five MPs, two ex-ministers and a former prime minister, not to mention more than 1,000 other individuals, including judges and prosecutors, with a conviction rate above 90%. This year we have investigated 12 members of parliament, two of them being former ministers, says Kvesi, who was appointed head of DNA in 2013. We have investigated two sitting ministers, one of whom went from his ministerial chair directly to pre-trial detention. In September, Bucharests mayor, Sorin Oprescu, was arrested after being accused of taking kickbacks from companies awarded contracts by the city. However, Ponta is by far the biggest target to date. According to Kvesi, the investigations into the outgoing prime minister lasted about four months, at the end of which he was formally indicted on multiple counts of forgery, money laundering and being an accessory to tax evasion, dating from a period between 2007 and 2008 when he was still a practising lawyer. Prosecutors had hoped to investigate him for activities while in office, but in June Romanias parliament voted down an attempt to lift his parliamentary immunity. Romanians seem to have been impressed by the activities of DNA: according to one recent poll, 60% of people said they trusted the agency, while only 11% said they trusted parliament. However, not everyone is happy with DNAs activities. Barely a week goes by without Kvesi being attacked in the media. After he was formally indicted, Ponta denounced the prosecutor in charge of his case on his Facebook page, saying Romanias only problem was the obsession of a totally unprofessional prosecutor trying to make a name by inventing and imagining facts and untrue situations from 10 years ago. Others have questioned the political motivations of prosecutors at DNA, though the agency has successfully gone after plenty of politicians on both sides of the parliamentary aisle.  Some have also criticised the use of wiretaps, suggesting it is behaviour taken from the playbook of the Securitate, the feared communist-era secret police. Kvesi dismisses those concerns, saying that every wiretap has to be authorised by a judge and that such monitoring is a tool used all over the world. It is used in EU member states. It is a common tool for prosecutors. The criticism and public attention has apparently had little impact on Kvesi. Before being chief prosecutor of DNA I was the general prosecutor of Romania for six years, so for the last nine years I have had enough time to get accustomed to these things. Fortunately there are people who also praise me, so things are balanced, she says. The biggest challenges for prosecutors come from politicians, she adds. Every two weeks they come with a new bill trying to change or amend the current provisions. Trying to limit our possibilities of investigations. Trying to amend the criminal code. Trying to deprive us of our tools to limit our possibilities of investigation. Whats curious is they never try to improve the legislation to help us more, she says. Strong support in Romania and within the EU has made it harder to hinder the efforts and independence of DNA. Every time we hear that they try to pass a new law limiting our possibilities, we go public and we take a stand regarding this issue, says Kvesi. Despite all this, there is still a long way to go. Romania ranked joint last among EU members on Transparency Internationals 2014 corruption perceptions index, alongside Italy, Greece and Bulgaria. But for Kvesi at least there is a sense that the agency is making a difference. I do think DNAs activities have changed the mentality of Romanian citizens, she says. They are aware now that they dont need to pay bribes in order to be granted their rights."

Yet Iordanescus manoeuvrings failed to outflank ONeill, who admitted that, while the Windsor Park encounter failed to showcase the prominent aspects of both teams, he had watched the best of Group F.

We are slightly disappointed that we didnt take the three points, ONeill explained. When we look back at it I think we will see it as a really good point. The most pleasing thing for me was the level of desire the team showed. We contested every single ball and covered a lot of ground. We have played better in the group  there is no doubt about that  but you have to give credit to the opposition because we were playing against a good team. With four games remaining, the worst-case scenario is surely a play-off place. At the outset of the campaign the top three was our focus, ONeill said. We are obviously in a very strong position to at least obtain that but we are at a stage that I as a manager and the players, want more than that.

Michael McGovern, of Hamilton Academical, is set to replace him. The 37-year-old Carroll has been suffering from abdominal pains through the week and did not train on Thursday or Friday. The manager, Michael ONeill, had hoped the Notts County player would recover in time for the game against the Group F leaders at Windsor Park. McGovern, who has only three caps, will thus be making his competitive international debut in a match where victory would elevate Northern Ireland to the top of the group halfway through the campaign. But ONeill is confident McGovern will excel and a fine display by the 30-year-old in a friendly against Scotland at Hampden Park in March suggests Northern Ireland can rely on him. The switch means the national goalkeeping coach, Maik Taylor  officially retired and whose last game was in September 2012 for Millwall  has been parachuted into the squad as back-up behind Trevor Carson of Cheltenham Town. ONeill says generating expectations and memories is fuelling his overachieving squad. He has worked tirelessly since the abject performances during the last World Cup qualifying campaign and, with four wins out of five, the 45-year-old former Northern Ireland international is in a welcome position of strength. The Ulstermen and qualification for major tournaments have been strangers to each other for a generation. Not since the 1986 World Cup have Northern Ireland troubled the bigger stages. The work put in by ONeill, who took over in 2011, is beginning to bear fruit, with the country buoyed by the teams industry and consistency. Everyone in the Northern Ireland camp is relishing Saturday nights contest, the manager said. We want to create expectations; we want to create memories, said ONeill, whose side are a point behind Romania. Some players have had big nights but nothing that comes close to qualification. We have given ourselves an opportunity. Its nice that people are talking about it [qualification] but we arent sitting here thinking formality. It has taken three years to get to this point. We have a group of honest boys looking forward to this. His squad hope to avenge their only setback in this campaign when a long night in Bucharests National Stadium ended in a 2-0 defeat. Northern Ireland have a more solid team than they had in that game last November for what will be the biggest game in memory for many fans in attendance. Around 10,000 will be shoe-horned into Windsor Park, with building work accelerated since an enforced demolition of the popular west stand, after major cracks appeared in foundations following the 2-1 March victory over Finland. The presence of the influential captain, Steven Davis, alongside the defender Jonny Evans and the winger Jamie Ward is a huge boost. It is also no coincidence that the defeat in Romania occurred with that trio absent. The nature of international football is that you need things to fall in line and with our resources we need that availability of players, ONeill said. I need Steven and Kyle [Lafferty] and Jonny to be fit. Its credit to my players the condition they are in and how they have worked. We have had no withdrawals, which says a lot. I see an edge to the players and see how they are ready to play. I am looking forward to the game and we couldnt have asked for the preparation to be any better. It helps that ONeill is getting the best out of the rangy striker Lafferty, who has five goals in qualifying, one behind the overall leading scorer, Englands Danny Welbeck. Yet, soaring hype aside, it is not, in essence, a win-at-all-costs match for ONeill against his counterpart, the veteran Anghel Iordanescu. This isnt a more significant game than Finland, he said. Finland was more important as we had come off a defeat [in Romania]. I just think it is a game where we can take a massive stride but equally, if it doesnt go our way, we will still be in second place. Romanias star midfielder, Lucian Sanmartean, and the vastly experienced defender Razvan Rat are out with injuries. is an admirer of Iordanescu  nicknamed The General  and feels Saturday nights visitors will be positive in nature. He said: They have a more attacking team than the previous coach, who was slightly more conservative. I know what team they are likely to play. Its hard to judge as they have only played two real games, but he set down a marker in Bucharest with his attacking approach and selection."

The team name that has seeped into conversations in the first week of the tournament, Japan, is enough to unsettle comfortable assumptions about who should be bowing down to whom and, although Romania are a rough and tumble outfit who gave France moments of flickering concern at the breakdown in midweek, Joe Schmidt is not one for assuming the sun will come up until it is blazing in his face. Despite being hailed as the oldest Irish starting lineup in the 24-year-history of the tournament, his squad have no more of a baby-pink glow than do their gnarled opponents, who come with nothing to show for their contribution but a lot of hard-earned bruises. Schmidt, as stats-savvy as any coach here, bore the look of a startled gazelle when his players long-toothedness was put to him at their posh training camp at St Georges Park in Burton-upon-Trent on Friday. Well, were the oldest and theyve got 728 caps, he said, so lets throw away the Zimmer frames. Like most maths myths, it is a tough one to pin down but, by the estimates of the travelling Irish media, the teams average age is 28.9, contrary to calculations of 29 and 245 days on the official Rugby World Cup website, which has Romania 102 days older and Tonga, the alleged leading greybeards, at 29.4. What is not disputed is that the scrumhalf, Eoin Reddan, is 55 days short of his 35th birthday. Whatever the numbers crunched and the actualit embroidered, the discussion confirms that age is a shifting concept in the modern game. Paul OConnell, going strong at 35, will be scratching around on the bench like some fevered colt today, according to Schmidt, so keen is the regular Ireland captain, to get his hands on the Romanians  or anyone, for that matter. One who does get his opportunity from the starting whistle in a lineup showing 12 changes from the team that walloped Canada 50-7 is Simon Zebo, an athlete who seems forever young at 25, although he is a relative novice, still, at full-back. He is a mercurial talent, no doubt, and he has mischief in his smile. Schmidt recognised his athletic gifts and the power of his personality from the start of his tenure, but reckons he is better suited to his needs at full-back rather than on the wing, where he has been intermittently brilliant and suspect. Whether Zebo agrees with the gaffer is difficult to tell, but is happy enough to go along with the plan. This seems to be a very happy Irish team. How did he view Schmidts regime and strategy? Its hard to say, Zebo says, shifting in his seat. Its just a different style of coach. Joe would coach totally different to Rob Penney or Anthony Foley coaching. Every coach is different. There are certain things I have to do to please one coach, and another thing to please another, so ... its been a relationship that Ive had to get used to. Im a better player for having worked under him. One aspect of Zebos play that needed work was cleaning out at rucks, an onerous task that comes the way of backs more closely involved in the heavy lifting upfront. Hes so detailed in every little facet of the game, Zebo says, and thats probably an area I didnt think would have needed so much work in the past but obviously it does, especially at this standard of play. You need to not have any weaknesses if you want to be a successful international. Schmidt, a smart thinker, recognises the value of Zebos creativity as well. Joe gives you the licence, he says. And if its not [working] and you do something hell let you know about it. The odds are that Zebo will not be drastically stretched against Romania who, for all the charitable words about their effort, have not beaten Ireland in eight attempts, shipping 346 points and posting 92. Surely, then, this is an opportunity to rack up plenty more. Zebo is not thinking along those lines. We feel like we have to go out and win the game first, he says. They showed they can easily upset anybody thats not on their game. They posed a lot of problems for France. France had a lot of turnovers in the first half and Romania probably could have had a few more scores in the first half. If he does get a burst of inspiration in what is expected to be a walkover, it might come from a recent meeting with Usain Bolt, who spent an evening with the team at their London hotel and struck Zebo, once an aspiring track star with a 100 metres best time of 11.1sec, as a locked-on legend. Zebos Martinique-born father, Arthur, was a good athlete, and his sister, Jessika, has represented Ireland as a hurdler. It was like a dream come true. We have a big athletics background in our family and to be able to sit next to the greatest athlete thats ever lived was amazing and just to get his insights into a few things around his training and his preparation for tournaments was something very special. I even got a FaceTime session with my sister back home, just so she could see him and drool over him even more. The odds are Irish fans will be doing the drooling on Sunday and, if Zebo gets an opening, he could be the player to raise the loudest cheers. He has never been to Wembley, but his good friend David Meyler was there for Hull City when they lost in the FA Cup final to Arsenal in 2014, and scored in the 5-3 semi-final win over Sheffield United. Hes going to miss this game, but hes coming to one or two later in the tournament. He didnt win there in a final, so Ill have to slag him about that."

Theyre ranked seventh in the world and they sit top of their qualifying group for Euro 2016, having conceded only one goal in six games. If they beat Hungary away on Friday, theyd be a win from securing their place in France next summer.  Related: Roy Hodgson tells England they can pull off Euro 2016 success  The president of the Romanian Football Federation, Razvan Burleanu, has been happy to take credit for Romanias rise, saying that he had a plan to take Romania into the worlds top 20, then the top 15, then the top 10, and merrily asserting that his country is ahead of schedule. But that is not the full story, not by any means. We used to have players at the biggest teams in Europe, said the national team coach Anghel Iordanescu, a member of the coaching staff and a late substitute in the final when Steaua won the European Cup in 1986. Now our teams are out of Europe earlier than they have been for 11 years and our players who are in the strong leagues are  with only a few exceptions  fringe players for small clubs. We are not seventh in the world. Quite how Romania have climbed to seventh in the world, in fact, is something of a mystery. In the past 15 years, the only tournament theyve qualified for was Euro 2008, where they didnt win a game and, although it was only a play-off defeat to Greece that cost them a place at the World Cup last year, they were a distant third in their group in qualifying for Euro 2012. Burleanus advisor Andrei Vochin has tried to take credit for arranging tough friendlies to take advantage of the system but the 0-0 draw against Argentina last year  the only game that realistically falls into that category  was under Burleanus predecessor, Mircea Sandu. This year, Romania have played four games. Theyve drawn 0-0 away to Northern Ireland and beaten the Faroe Islands 1-0. That, somehow, has earned them more ranking points (786.91) in 2015 than any nation in the world other than Wales (817.58), who have won in Israel and at home against Belgium.

Iordanescu has always projected a sense of world-weariness, but its hard to argue with his assessment. The captain Vlad Chiriches, sold by Tottenham to Napoli this summer, is probably their highest profile player, although he missed training on Wednesday with injury, and while there is healthy competition in the goalkeeping department  Fiorentinas Ciprian Tatarusanu battling it out with Sunderlands Costel Pantilimon while Silviu Lung Jnr, the son of Romanias 1990 World Cup goalkeeper, is a promising third choice  elsewhere the cupboard is largely bare.

In several instances, steps forward towards the foundation of press freedom have been matched by steps backward, especially, of course, in those countries ruled by Soviet-style (and Russian-sponsored) despots. Even in countries that have sought to embrace western-style democracy, it has been evident that western-style freedom of expression has been somewhat fragile. One of the reasons, arguably the overriding reason, is the fact that in most of central and eastern Europe, monarchic dictatorship was replaced by communist dictatorship, so democracy had never previously been allowed to blossom. Two academics who have examined the media landscape in eastern Europe, Paolo Mancini and Jan Zielonka, argue that democratic institutions and media institutions in the region emerged simultaneously and interdependently, in a period of rapid and often chaotic reform. It means that the kind of democracy evident in the west, underpinned by the rule of law, political pluralism and freedom of speech, did not exist prior to the collapse of communism and is still in its early stages in several states. One such country is Romania, the subject of a study by Manuela Preoteasa and Andrei Schwartz, which has been published by a new thinktank, the Centre for Media Transparency. Their report, The men who bit the (watch) dogs, comes at a time of internal chaos, with two media tycoons sent to jail, another one facing various criminal charges and the prime minister, Victor Ponta, having been indicted on charges of tax evasion, money laundering, conflict of interest and making false statements. The study, dealing with newspapers, TV and radio, concentrates on media ownership and follows three broad stages of development: 1990-1999, and a quasi absence of foreign investment; 2000-2010, years of ownership opacity, with foreign investors acting as front operators for Romanian businessmen; 2011 onwards, a period of disruption with several leading owners facing criminal investigation for a variety of offences. Even more fascinating than this developing story are the five ownership profiles. Of those, one stands out. It concerns Ronald Lauder, son of the cosmetics tycoon Este Lauder, who was briefly a defence official in the Reagan administration and US ambassador to Austria. The authors cite a critic as saying of him: If you talk about tabloidisation and concentration, we can call Lauder a Murdoch. He founded the Central Media Enterprise (CME) and, by 1997, it had TV stations in Slovenia, Romania, Slovakia and Ukraine.  In Romania, the CMEs presence was most obvious through PRO TV, the countrys most watched channel that combines entertainment and news, with the accent on the former.  CME entered the Romanian market through Adrian Srbu, a media affairs minister in Romanias first post-communist government prior to setting up his own media group.  Srbu, appointed as chief executive and chairman of CME, described himself as the only Romanian appointed as a CEO of a publicly listed American company. But, in February 2014, Srbu was charged with tax evasion, money laundering and embezzlement. Lauder withdrew from the board. Srbu sold all of his shares in CME and withdrew from all positions. And Pro TV was acquired by Time Warner. In February 2015, Srbu was detained for 30 days after being charged with tax evasion, money laundering and embezzlement. He has since been released while awaiting trial. This case history is not, however, unique, which is the whole point of the study. It illustrates the way in which Romanias media has not only been haunted by its communist past but also penetrated by, and dominated by, foreign capital. Source: Centre for Media Transparency"

There was only one exit from the basement club, and other safety guidelines had not been followed. It soon transpired that local authorities had granted Colectiv permits without reference to legal procedures or conducting checks. Thirty-two people died and more than 150 were injured. Most were young fans, but one was a Roma mother of five who was working for the club without a contract. Many Romanians felt clear about what to blame  widespread corruption and a malfunctioning state apparatus  and took to the streets. About 25,000 people marched in Bucharest, and thousands more marched across Romania. On Thursday this week, after a night of protests, the Romanian prime minister, Victor Ponta, resigned. Unconvinced, Romanians went back to the streets, with 70,000 out all over the country  Related: Bucharest nightclub fire: PM and government resign after protests  The explosion of pain and anger since the fire is massive but not sudden. In July, Ponta was indicted for tax evasion, money laundering and conflicts of interest. Last month a policeman in the security detail of the interior minister, Gabriel Oprea, died in a road accident during a trip whose official purpose is being questioned. Protesters called for Opreas resignation but he refused to step down. This week protesters renewed their calls for Oprea and Ponta to resign, adding to the list Cristian Piedone, the local mayor responsible for granting Colectiv its permit. With next years elections in mind, Ponta must have seen the weeks marches as a final blow (and a chance for a less humiliating exit). Piedone too stepped down. Yet Pontas resignation is not the real news from Romania. What is important is how Romanians have turned sadness and frustration into solidarity and responsibility. Lines to donate blood for the wounded were so long that hospitals had to send people home. Owners of music clubs announced that they were voluntarily closing down because they too would not pass safety tests. During the demonstrations, slogans read Not caring kills, I have been quiet  now I am shouting, and Reset Romania. On Facebook pages of the protests (and there will be more), discussions are about how to ensure firefighters conduct proper checks of buildings, or the need to increase the health budget so that in the future the ambulance system and hospitals can cope with large numbers of severely wounded. Everyone is talking about relying on the power of citizens to change the system. Like the anger, this is not new. Its a constructive spirit that has been carefully cultivated by activists since 2013, when public mobilisation saved the village of Roia Montan from being destroyed to make way for a goldmine. Back then, protestors said the fight for Roia Montan was the revolution of our generation. A language of hope and action began to grow, replacing the generalised post-socialist cynicism. Once Roia Montan was saved, many activists stayed connected. They fought to save forests and parks, to oppose evictions of the poor from their homes and to limit police abuses. Tens of thousands more followed these efforts via social and traditional media. Put to shame for not having covered Roia Montan, TV channels scrambled to cover activists stunts and messages. In todays Europe, public anger is often capitalised upon by right-wing populists and the far right. Across the continent, from David Camerons UK to Viktor Orbns Hungary, frustration with economic precariousness is often channelled into antipathy against migrants. In Poland each 11 November  the countrys national day  thousands of people (many of them marginalised youths) participate in marches organised by far-right groups. But in Romania, grassroots efforts have managed to concentrate popular dissatisfaction with failures to take responsibility for public life. Its not unique to Romania and its extremely fragile. But for a fleeting second, maybe we should acknowledge the possibility of a positive collective spirit emerging from terrible tragedy."

What had been, at the height of its 1980s popularity, the single biggest-selling wine in the UK, was now, I thought, no more than a piece of nostalgia</p> <p>After all, the fall from grace of the wine industries in both Bulgaria and its fellow late Soviet-era export success, Romania, had been as sad as it was spectacular and, in retrospect, inevitable. As late as the mid-1990s, the Bulgarians were selling more than 50m bottles of wine a year in the UK, with the Romanians, with their budget pinot noirs, not far behind. By the time I made my first trip as a wine journalist to Bulgaria in the early-2000s, however, both were selling less than a tenth of that. The reasons why were evident throughout that trip. During the day, I was shown a procession of near-derelict vineyards and unkempt, eerily quiet winemaking facilities (it was hard to call these grimly utilitarian buildings <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c5><93>wineries<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c2><9d>). In the evening, two doleful Bulgarian wine exporters detailed the difficulties facing winemakers both before and after the end of Communism: corruption; the haphazard redistribution of vineyard land to private owners with no wine-making experience; an absence of properly trained local winemakers; a general absence of money.</p> <p>The mood was bleak; I have yet to go on a more downbeat wine trip. But there were already the beginnings of a recovery thanks to entrepreneurial winemakers who were aware that parts of Bulgaria and Romania had the climate and soils to make high quality wine and at considerably lower cost than elsewhere in Europe. They were also conscious that both countries were likely to join the EU, saw an opportunity and began to embark on the complicated process of buying up vineyard land. The investors were an exotic cast that included Italian textile magnate Edoardo Miroglio (whose eponymous set-up in Bulgaria<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s Thracian Valley joins Piedmont<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s Tenuta Carretta in his family<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s wine portfolio), a German-born, Bordeaux-based aristocrat, Count Stephan von Neipperg (owner of top St-Emilion Ch<c3><83><c2><a2>teau Canon La Gaffeli<c3><83><c2><a8>re among others, and partner in the Enira project in Bulgaria<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s Bessa Valley), and the British couple Philip and Elvira Cox (who own and run the large Romanian Cramele Recas winery). Their projects and wines may be very different in scale and ambition but collectively, their investment and experience seems to have flicked a switch in both countries.</p> <p>In the decade since there<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s been a flood of imaginative new ventures, the sort of individualistic, small-scale producers that would never have been possible in the Soviet era. I<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>m thinking of returning exiles such as Romanian royal Baroness Ileana Kripp-Costinescu, who, with her German husband, Baron Jacob Kripp (a couple straight out of <em>The Grand Budapest Hotel</em>), has revived her family<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s 300-year-old Prince Stirbey estate in the Transylvanian Alps. Then there are maverick small-producers such as Ogi Tcvetanov and Adrianna Serebrinova, who have transformed a former state-run Bulgarian operation into a small-scale delight at Borovitza, or the New Zealand and Austrian-trained Petar Georgiev, the talented winemaker at creative new Bulgarian producer, Ross-Idi.</p> <p>Not everything these producers or their peers make is outstanding, far from it. And with the possible exception of Cramele Recas (and its fellow British-affiliated producer, Halewood Romania) I don<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>t expect any of them to approach the sales of the 1980s. But retailers are much more willing to list wines from this part of the world than they have been in years <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><80><9c> and that in itself is a step forward after the dark days of the 1990s and 2000s.

What had been, at the height of its 1980s popularity, the single biggest-selling wine in the UK, was now, I thought, no more than a piece of nostalgia After all, the fall from grace of the wine industries in both Bulgaria and its fellow late Soviet-era export success, Romania, had been as sad as it was spectacular and, in retrospect, inevitable. As late as the mid-1990s, the Bulgarians were selling more than 50m bottles of wine a year in the UK, with the Romanians, with their budget pinot noirs, not far behind. By the time I made my first trip as a wine journalist to Bulgaria in the early-2000s, however, both were selling less than a tenth of that. The reasons why were evident throughout that trip. During the day, I was shown a procession of near-derelict vineyards and unkempt, eerily quiet winemaking facilities (it was hard to call these grimly utilitarian buildings wineries). In the evening, two doleful Bulgarian wine exporters detailed the difficulties facing winemakers both before and after the end of Communism: corruption; the haphazard redistribution of vineyard land to private owners with no wine-making experience; an absence of properly trained local winemakers; a general absence of money. The mood was bleak; I have yet to go on a more downbeat wine trip. But there were already the beginnings of a recovery thanks to entrepreneurial winemakers who were aware that parts of Bulgaria and Romania had the climate and soils to make high quality wine and at considerably lower cost than elsewhere in Europe. They were also conscious that both countries were likely to join the EU, saw an opportunity and began to embark on the complicated process of buying up vineyard land. The investors were an exotic cast that included Italian textile magnate Edoardo Miroglio (whose eponymous set-up in Bulgarias Thracian Valley joins Piedmonts Tenuta Carretta in his familys wine portfolio), a German-born, Bordeaux-based aristocrat, Count Stephan von Neipperg (owner of top St-Emilion Chteau Canon La Gaffelire among others, and partner in the Enira project in Bulgarias Bessa Valley), and the British couple Philip and Elvira Cox (who own and run the large Romanian Cramele Recas winery). Their projects and wines may be very different in scale and ambition but collectively, their investment and experience seems to have flicked a switch in both countries. In the decade since theres been a flood of imaginative new ventures, the sort of individualistic, small-scale producers that would never have been possible in the Soviet era. Im thinking of returning exiles such as Romanian royal Baroness Ileana Kripp-Costinescu, who, with her German husband, Baron Jacob Kripp (a couple straight out of The Grand Budapest Hotel), has revived her familys 300-year-old Prince Stirbey estate in the Transylvanian Alps. Then there are maverick small-producers such as Ogi Tcvetanov and Adrianna Serebrinova, who have transformed a former state-run Bulgarian operation into a small-scale delight at Borovitza, or the New Zealand and Austrian-trained Petar Georgiev, the talented winemaker at creative new Bulgarian producer, Ross-Idi. Not everything these producers or their peers make is outstanding, far from it. And with the possible exception of Cramele Recas (and its fellow British-affiliated producer, Halewood Romania) I dont expect any of them to approach the sales of the 1980s. But retailers are much more willing to list wines from this part of the world than they have been in years  and that in itself is a step forward after the dark days of the 1990s and 2000s. And the more new-wave Bulgarian and Romanian producers I taste the more Im convinced these countries are going to be serious players in years to come. That, you could say, is the future. If you want a taste of the past, Sainsburys, while not exactly enthusiastic about it, assures me 4.75 will still buy you a bottle of so-so Bulgarian Cabernet in 488 of its stores. Edoardo Miroglio Soli Pinot Noir, Nova Zagora 2011 (from 9.95, Swig.co.uk, The Wine Society; Roberson Wine)Made at an Italian-owned winery by an Italian winemaker who used to work with top barolo producer Luca Sandrone, this is exceptionally good value pinot noir: succulently red fruited, silky soft, sweetly earthy and graceful. SantIlia Cabernet Sauvignon/Cabernet Franc/Melnik, Elenovo, Thracian Lowlands, Bulgaria 2012 (8.99, Waitrose)Bulgaria made its name with its great value take on Bordeaux-style reds. a little of the local melnik along with the two cabernets, this appealingly fresh, crunchy blend, with its blackcurrant and mint leaf, proves it still has the knack. Cramele Recas Frunza Pinot Noir, Banat, Romania 2013 (7, Oddbins)Like the Bulgarians with cabernet, the Romanians have been doing budget pinots for years, and these days Cramele Recas are behind many of the most appetising examples. They may not be Burgundy-complex, but this is a vibrant juicy, rhubarb-and-strawberry lighter red for salmon. Prince Stirbey Tamaioasa Romaneasca Sec 2013 (9.95, The Wine Society)Tamaioasa romaneasca is, according to the Wine Society, a Romanian relative of muscat, and there is a sense of that varietys floral grapey charm in this dry white, which, combined with a fluent, spring stream freshness, makes for an irresistibly airy, refreshing spring-into-summer white. Borovitza Bella Rada, Bulgaria 2011 (13.95, Berry Bros and Rudd)Rikatskeli has begun to get a following in the UK through the amphora-aged wines of Georgia, where the white grape variety originates. This dry Bulgarian take is just as interesting: full of pithy lemon and grapefruit but topped with a subtly honeyed character. Bessa Valley Enira Estate Red, Bulgaria 2009 (11.99, Ocado)From St-Emilion star Stephan von Neippergs impressive Bulgarian project, a merlot-led Bordeaux-style red that balances creamy vanilla oak and ripe plum and blackcurrant fruit. Look out, too, for Eniras reserve bottlings, such as the very serious BV 2009 (37.50, hedonism.co.uk)  This article was amended on 19 March 2015 to correct the spelling of Stephan von Neippergs name."

Told in flashback during the filming of the movie, Closer To The Moon offers almost no sense of period or of Soviet-era grimness  you just have to take the narrators word for it. Anachronisms abound  partying like animals? awesome?  outnumbered only by evil-empire cliches: the Securitate hacks are all rail-thin, the party bosses all have big, leonine Brezhnev-Miloevi hair-dos. As fluffed scenes piled up on top of botched opportunities, I briefly succumbed to the illusion I was watching it on an aeroplane  the place it deserves to be watched  while trapped in a bad movie inside an even worse movie.

Charming and handsome, he is a committed environmentalist, enthusiastic sportsman and keen supporter of childrens charities. He had even moved out of the palace because he was fed up that pizza firms wouldnt deliver to him there. But this week, 94-year-old King Michael suggested that his 30-year-old grandson was not up to royal standards, formally cutting him out of the line of succession. [The King thinks] Romania will need a head of the family who is dignified, moral, thinks of others and is hardworking, respecting the principles of the family, said the royal familys spokesman, Ioan Luca Vlad.  At this point in time he believes that it is best if Nicholas continues to follow his own dreams outside of Romania, outside the line of succession and outside of the royal family. The decision set off speculation in Romania and beyond about what had gone wrong. Swiss-born, British-raised Nicholas had only formally been named third-in-line to the throne five years earlier, when he moved to Romania to take up the unofficial role. The King had already cut one daughter, Irina, out of the line of succession after she pleaded guilty to helping run a cockfighting business in Oregon with her husband last year.  Vlad said this case was different because Nicholas was not being punished for any misdeeds. It is a preventive move, that stops this distinction between what he [Nicholas] wants and what the royal family is, from blowing up into something that would be irreparable, Vlad said. It was a decision taken in harmony. Some Romanians speculated that a jealous relative had sought to edge Nicholas out of the succession, the Associated Press reported, but the change in the line of succession  which could be reversed by King Michaels heir  seems only to have made him more popular. He has 23,000 likes on his Facebook page, topped by a photo of him with a mountain bike in beautiful mountain scenery, apparently on a 1,000km fundraising trip he made in April from Transylvania to the Black Sea port of Constanta. On Tuesday, Nicholas  who will now be known simply as Nicholas Medford-Mills, his fathers last name  said he supported his grandfathers decision and welcomed the chance to fade back into a life of anonymity. I find the lifestyle and rigours of being a prince of Romania too heavy for me so I will continue to pursue my activities outside of Romania, the statement said. Perhaps in a prelude to his departure from royal life, Nicholas had earlier this year moved out of the Elisabeta palace, which was also home to his grandfather, his aunt  Crown Princess Margaret  and her husband, Radu Duda. He took an apartment in a district 15 minutes drive away, near a park where he could walk his Jack Russell terrier. Although the family have no official position in modern Romania, they have taken on some roles similar to royals in other European countries, working with charities, representing the country informally and sometimes dabbling in politics. His grandfather first took the throne more than 80 years ago as a child, and played a key role in overthrowing Romanias fascist dictator Ion Antonescu in 1944, but abdicated and left the country three years later. He said the communist government blackmailed him to step down, threatening to kill more than 1,000 imprisoned students if he did not leave. He would not return for over 40 years, when his popularity alarmed the government and he was effectively barred again. But in the 1990s he won back his citizenship and in 2001 the government granted him the same rights as all other former heads of state  including an official residence with staff and security, a car and chauffeur and a living allowance. On his 90th birthday, the king made his first speech to parliament in over six decades, calling for cleaner politics and a shifting of the guard. The time has come ... to finally break with the bad habits of the past, Michael said, adding there should be an end to demagogy, selfishness and attempts to cling to power. "

During the period between the wars, Bucharests epithet as the Paris of the east was accurate, up to a point. However, todays cityscape is largely one of imposing socialist architecture, the result of former dictator Nicolae Ceauescus savage redevelopment project during the 1980s  the bleakest of communist years for Romanians. Things are much brighter these days, however, and lurking among this tangle of concrete are some wonderful art nouveau buildings (many housing terrific museums), ancient churches and monasteries, lush parkland, lakes and elegant boulevards. Bucharests culinary scene is at last worth getting excited about, while the city has few peers anywhere in the Balkans when it comes to nightlife. Above all, though, the old town  also called Lipscani after the main street that crosses the area  has become the citys go-to party place and, on any given night, youll find the bars full to bursting. With the ferocious summer heat just a hazy memory, late autumn is the perfect time to explore this compelling citys unexpected delights. Bucharests old town was mercifully untouched by second world war bombs and Ceauescus bulldozers and is the citys most charismatic neighbourhood. Although much of the area remains agreeably tatty, a massive regeneration project has transformed many of its hitherto grubby-looking streets and buildings, the most spectacular example being the new Crtureti Carusel bookshop (carturesticarusel.ro) on strada Lipscani. The pint-sized Stavropoleos Church, with ornate carvings in stone and wood both inside and out, is another architectural must-see. Whether you consider it a thing of beauty or (more likely) brute ugly, the Palace of Parliament (aka the Peoples House, cdep.ro) is indisputably jaw-dropping. Constructed at Ceauescus behest, its scale and opulence are head-spinning: 12 storeys (including four underground levels, one a nuclear bunker), 1,100 rooms, 4,500 chandeliers, and so on  although apparently not even 700 architects could satisfy Ceauescus, or rather his wifes, ever-changing whims. Guided tours (5) take in a dozen or so of the largest and most extravagant rooms and conclude on the balconied terrace, affording fabulous views down bulevardul Unirii. For more Ceauescu-linked culture, head to the piata Revolutiei and check out the pockmarked buildings. The square was the focal point of fighting during the 1989 revolution, which led to the end of the dictators regime. The National Village Museum (adults 2, seniors 1, children 50p, muzeul-satului.ro) is on the shores of lake Herstru and exhibits vernacular architecture from all over Romania. Comprising some 300 dwellings  churches, workshops, windmills and so on  theres much ground to cover, so keep a keen eye out for the ingenious dug-out (or pit) homes from Oltenia and the iconic wooden churches from Maramure in northern Romania. Take a stroll around Cimigiu Gardens, the oldest and largest park in central Bucharest. Its a welcome dollop of green space in the city and theres a boating lake for would-be rowers. For a break from the noise of downtown, make your way to the enchanting Mogooaia Palace (entry 1, palatebrancovenesti.ro), which is about 10km north-west of the centre. Designed by the 17th-century ruler of the Wallachia region, Constantin Brncoveanu (who occasionally resided here), its a red-brick structure typical of the region, and the interior retains some lovely detail, not least dazzling Venetian mosaic flooring and carved wooden doors. After, its worth taking a walk around the grounds and woods. Fine dining remains something of a novelty concept in Bucharest, but elegantly understated The Artist (13 strada Nicolae Tonitza, +40 728 318871, theartist.ro), discreetly tucked away on one of the old towns quieter streets, is leading the way. The restaurants young Dutch chef creates inventive dishes such as roasted quail and crab with apricot and white chocolate (12), and elderflower parfait with black cherries and prosecco (5); and if choosing between the dishes proves impossible, have a cheeky bash at the spoon-tasting menu (12), for a little taste of everything. Home-style cooking doesnt come much better than at Becas Kitchen (80 strada Mihai Eminescu, +40 744 344 700, becaskitchen.ro), a little family-run restaurant on an unassuming residential street, a short walk north of the city centre. Dishes  around half a dozen starters and a similar number of mains  are chalked up on a blackboard, which Beca herself will bring to the table and delight in explaining. Theres nothing particularly fussy or complicated about the food  for example, baked seabass with roasted veg and beetroot (10), or rhubarb tart with vanilla sauce (3)  its the simplicity, much like the place itself, that makes it a winner. The location isnt the most exciting but that shouldnt dissuade anyone from venturing to Pukka Tukka (13 piaa Amzei 13, +40 733 145034, pukkafood.ro), a super organic food bar. Try a cooked Pukka Tukka breakfast (6), or a lunch of salmon with baby spinach (8). All the drinks, including coffee, fresh apple juice and a selection of local wines, are 100% organic, too. The wicker-walled interior features barely half a dozen small tables, each with stools made from cork, but there is a pleasantly shaded patio for alfresco eating. Caru cu Bere (5 strada Stavropoleos, +40 213 137560, carucubere.ro), literally beer cart, is the first restaurant many tourists make a beeline for but its also where the locals go, which says much about its authenticity. Chic waiting staff scuttle around the ornate restaurant, doling out Romanian standards such as mittitei (grilled spiced sausages, 3) and tochitur (pork stew, 7), while the house musicians belt out Romanian folk tunes. Great fun. Old town cafs are ten-a-penny, but bright and buzzy Cremeria Emilia (38 strada Francez, facebook.com/cremeriaemilia) knocks spots off all of them. The all-white interior looks fab but, on a sunny day, sitting at one of its pavement tables is the thing to do. The menu lists an irresistible selection of ice-creams, and enticing bowls of semifreddo and panna cotta, all of which are freshly made on the premises. The coffees not bad, either. Romanian wine remains something of a mystery to outsiders, so Abels Wine Bar (10 strada Nicolae Tonitza, abelswinebar.ro)  one of several to have emerged recently  is just the spot to begin your education by sampling the many varieties of wine, most of which are available by the glass. Of all the old town bars in which to while away the night, Bordello (9 strada elari, bordellos.ro) stands out. Packed most nights, its a bit of an all-rounder, variously staging live music, cabaret, burlesque and quiz nights. Most people, though, are happy just to tuck into a plate of tapas (from 2) and a good old-fashioned pint (from 3). Lots of coffee houses have opened recently but Origo (9 strada Lipscani, origocoffee.ro) is the one to aim for. Its a small, easy-going joint run by an enthusiastic team of baristas who really know their beans; be it a cappuccino, ristretto or lungo, the quality is consistently high and the service impeccable. At dusk, the venue morphs into a brilliant cocktail-cum-wine bar. Dating from 1914, the Athenee Palace Hilton (doubles from 250, hiltonbucharest.com) was formerly a hotbed of conspiracy and espionage  in short, the sort of place youd expect James Bond to stay. Its infinitely more refined these days, though no less glamorous, with its magnificent marble lobby and luxury rooms. Facilities include a gym, spa and basement pool and the hotels English Bar is one of the most sophisticated  and expensive  rendezvous points in the city. Tucked away on a sleepy residential street, Hotel Christina (doubles from 79, hotelchristina.ro) looks rather anonymous but its genuinely something a little bit special. The solar-panelled roof gives you some idea of the hotels orientation: its eco-driven ethos extends to its rooms, which come in four fetching colour schemes: pink, yellow, lilac and grape-green.

Its in a tranquil spot, 20 minutes walk from the city centre, and its 22 rooms are painted in warm, peachy tones. In warmer weather, breakfast is served on its shady terrace.

An earlier version described President Klaus Iohannis as the leader of the opposition National Liberal party. Alina Gorghiu took over that post in December 2014.</p>",2015,"Victor Ponta, Romanias prime minister, said on Tuesday that he was prepared to go to court to answer allegations of money-laundering, forgery and tax evasion as the countrys president called on him resign. Prosecutors announced on Friday that they had launched an investigation into the prime minister over suspected money laundering and tax evasion, sending one of the EUs poorest countries into a political crisis. Ponta denies the allegations and says he has documentary proof of his innocence. In an interview with the Guardian, he rejected a renewed demand by Klaus Iohannis, Romanias president, for him to resign, saying that neither Romania nor Europe could afford political instability in the face of Russian expansionist moves to the East. Romania is in the most sensitive area of Europe, Ponta said. We hope we will close this small but intense political crisis and we will get back to work, because Europe requires Romania to be stable and predictable in this region. I think only Russia will open the champagne bottles if Romania will be in long political crisis. Ponta was speaking in his office minutes after the countrys senate voted by a large majority against lifting his immunity to criminal investigation, drawing a stinging rebuke from the president and the prospect of a constitutional stand-off. I regret that has parliament has turned into a shield for the protection of an individual, Victor Ponta, who is suspected of criminal acts, Iohannis said in a written statement. It is conclusive proof of huge irresponsibility and defiance towards the public, because the majority MPs are obstructing justice and will destroy the parliament as an institution, harming the image of Romania, in order to save one person. The president added: I furthermore consider the key to getting out of this situation is the resignation of Mr Victor Ponta as prime minister. Ponta, the leader of the majority Social Democratic party, rejected the presidents demand for his resignation as politically motivated, intended to rally support for the Liberals in elections due next year. Im sure that president Iohannis will simply do his job and his statements were simply statements to support his party who are in opposition and who want to win elections next year, Ponta said. But the president should be the president of all citizens not just of his party.  The parliamentary vote to maintain the prime ministers immunity only protects Ponta against some of the potential charges raised on Friday by the National Anticorruption Directorate (DNA)  specifically those alleging conflict of interest while he has been in office. It does not apply to DNA allegations that Ponta was involved in money-laundering, forgery and tax evasion in 2007 and 2008 when he was working as a private lawyer. According to a statement issued on Friday by the agency, he is said to have falsified invoices for work he never performed to help a business associate dodge tax. I am still being investigated ... and I will answer to all the prosecutors questions regarding the allegation that eight years ago as a lawyer I was accomplice to another lawyer for a 10,000 tax evasion. I will go in front of the prosecutor and if its going to be the case, in front of a judge as an absolutely normal citizen, he said. Ponta vowed that, if he was found guilty on those charges, he would resign.  If I am declared guilty by a judge, of course. Thats absolutely clear, he said. But he added that he could prove his innocence in court, and had not yet been asked to give his version of events. I did have all the checks by the fiscal authorities and the national integrity agency and both said everything was perfectly legal so I will just present all these papers to the prosecutor. I will give all the explanations, and Im sure everything will be clear then. The DNA confirmed that it was still pursuing the investigations into Pontas role in the tax evasion case. That case will be passed to an investigating magistrate who will decide whether it should go to court.  Meanwhile, Ponta said he stuck by his earlier call for the law to be changed to lift the immunity of MPs in cases of corruption. That did not apply to him, he insisted, as the allegations against him while prime minister involved alleged conflict of interest rather than corruption.  He also said he did not support legislative changes being considered in parliament to limit the power of state prosecutors, arguing that judicial self-policing was the answer to occasional over-zealous prosecutions. I dont think the problem is the legislation, he said. I just think we should find a mechanism that avoids abuses and mistakes.  Laura Stefan, an anti-corruption expert at the Expert Forum, a Bucharest thinktank, expressed scepticism over Pontas claims he was not behind the legislative push to curtail the DNAs powers.  He is the leader of the ruling party pushing for the changes. So how can he be against them when his party is pushing for them  he just showed us all how he holds his party with a very strong grip, she said.  This article was amended on 11 June 2015. An earlier version described President Klaus Iohannis as the leader of the opposition National Liberal party. Alina Gorghiu took over that post in December 2014."

The Romanian authors murder mystery, The Book of Mirrors, has been snapped up by publishers in 23 countries  with auctions having involved up to 11 publishers in each territory. Smaller countries such as Iceland, which tend to wait until an untested English-language book has proved itself in the UK and US, have also bought the novel before its publication in 2017.  Chirovici, 51, who lives in Reading, wrote 10 literary mystery novels in Romania over the past two decades, but the market was too small for him to live off his books and he worked as a journalist. Now he is expected to make a seven-figure sum from the publishing deals alone. He said: Im not sure I realise whats happening. It is very overwhelming and unexpected.   Related: The top 10 Agatha Christie mysteries  The author, who writes as EO Chirovici, was signed up by the first British agency he tried, Peters Fraser and Dunlop (PFD), after he was rejected by six US agents. Recalling their rejection letters, Chirovici said: They didnt explain why. Rachel Mills, of PFD, described The Book of Mirrors as a really well-plotted murder mystery. She added: It is such an incredible novel, so sophisticated. You would never know it was written by someone whose first language wasnt English.  Marilia Savvides, who has only just become an agent at PFD, had fallen in love with it immediately and signed him up as her first author five weeks ago.

In a statement, Centurys editor, Francesca Pathak, described the book as a cross between Donna Tartts The Secret History and Carlos Ruiz Zafns The Shadow of the Wind. She said: [It] is a truly brilliant book which grabbed me from the first page. This is going to be a huge debut launch for us. Set in the present day, Chirovicis novel is a story about the murder of a charismatic professor at Princeton University in the late 1980s. It begins with a New York literary agent receiving a partial manuscript called The Book of Mirrors in which the author  a student at Princeton at the time of the murder  hints at a confession or a revelation about who committed the murder. The writer dies before the literary agent has a chance to find out more, sparking a quest to solve the crime. Mills said: The opening is really good. Theres a letter that comes with the manuscript ... saying this manuscript is going to tell you what really happened. Chirovici said that his literary inspirations are very classical, and include Ernest Hemingway, John Steinbeck and William Golding.  He came to Britain because his son was studying at Cardiff University and his wife had a great job offer as a financial analyst. My intention was to become a full-time writer, he said."

She is regarded as one of Romanias finest modernist artworks, yet the Bucharest governments refusal to say whether it wants to buy her has left the 20m (15m) sculpture in a murky legal limbo, and its owners unable to sell. The statue, The Wisdom of the Earth by Constantin Brncui, has a history that reflects the tumult in its creators native land. First sold in 1911, it was confiscated by the communists in 1957 and became the subject of a lengthy legal battle after the fall of the dictator Nicolae Ceauescu, ending in 2008 with it returned to the family of its original owner. The latest instalment began in September 2014 when the family announced it was putting Brncuis statue, his most celebrated work still in Romania, up for sale. As an artwork considered a national treasure, Romania has a right of first refusal should it wish to keep the Brncui out the hands of a foreign gallery or collector. But by failing to officially respond or enter into meaningful negotiations, those involved in the sale say the Romanian state has in effect blocked the legal owners from selling to anyone else. International galleries such as the Tate Modern, which already owns four Brncui sculptures and could be one potential destination, are unlikely to push ahead while legal uncertainties exist. If you want to sell a work of art that is a national treasure, the state has a pre-emption right to buy, but it must give an answer within 30 days of notification, said Bogdan Grabowski, the lawyer acting for the Romascu family, the sculptures owners. Until now the state hasnt proposed a certain sum or asserted that it is willing to take its pre-emption rights. Brncui, who spent much of his life living in Paris, is considered Romanias most important artist, and his sculptures change hands for up to 26m. The Wisdom of the Earth is considered one of his defining works. The truth is that it is an iconic sculpture for Romanians; its an iconic image that is present in all the books about our national identity. The state used it a lot in its cultural propaganda and transformed it into an icon of the Romanian soul, said Alexandru Baldea, managing partner of Artmark, the Romanian auction house charged with selling the piece. Legally were allowed to sell it. But as a matter of fact we cannot sell it. Basically we are obliged to wait for an official response from the state. The challenges surrounding first the ownership and now the sale of The Wisdom of the Earth underscore the difficult situation in Romania in relation to the many works of art confiscated by the former communist regime. Roxana Theodorescu, the director of the National Museum of Art of Romania, told MPs in January that since 2000 the National Museum had returned 2,000 works of art to their original owners, and that in the near future it would be returning 253 more, with several hundred others under litigation. I invite you to visit our museum as quickly as possible because with the frequency we are returning works it is possible that in the near future you wont have anything to look at, she told those present, according to Romanian media. Many believe that the Romanian state simply doesnt have the funds available to buy the sculpture, despite earlier comments made by the then minister of culture, Kelemen Hunor, who last September told Romanian media that if the price was right the authorities needed to find the money in the budget. There have been suggestions that a public campaign within Romania could raise part of the money needed through donations. There is a precedent: one of Bucharests main concert halls was partly funded through a public offering in the 1880s. Those involved in the attempted sale of The Wisdom of the Earth have little sympathy for the Romanian state. It is a similar situation with the works of art confiscated by the Nazis, claimed Grabowski, the family lawyer, who said the legal process behind reclaiming works of art confiscated during the communist period had been unnecessarily complex. The Wisdom of the Earth was originally purchased in 1911 by Gheorghe Romascu, a Romanian engineer and art lover. His daughters began the process of trying to reclaim the sculpture shortly after the 1989 revolution but encountered a drawn-out legal process that only ended in 2008. One of the two daughters died in 2006. The surviving daughter is 92. She is expecting at any time that the state will cause more problems. She would prefer it to be sold overseas, Grabowski said. The Romanian ministry of culture did not respond to repeated interview requests for this article."

Ion Jinga, the Romanian ambassador in London, has written to the producers of the three-part series accusing them of reinforcing negative stereotypes. Meanwhile three members of the Romanian parliament have written to the British ambassador in Bucharest to claim that the channel was inciting hatred and discrimination. The MPs letter, seen by the Observer, adds: We kindly ask you to consider what your reaction would be if TVR, the Romanian public television channel, would launch a campaign of denigration pointed towards the British citizens in our country, generalising cases of alcoholism and paedophilia displayed by some British citizens (cases we are sure you are aware of), and turning them into the general image of all British citizens in Romania. The documentary broadcast by Channel 4 does the exact same thing. Channel 4 says the series  which ended on Tuesday  explored the lives of Romanians trying to make a new life in Britain, and sought the truth behind the headlines about immigration. The first programme featured Alex, who lived in a car park next to Victoria station in London, and a Romany man who struggled to settle in Liverpool. The second and third episodes also examined the poverty of Romania, where the richest 10% would be among the poorest 10% in the UK. The narrator says: When you live in a place as poor as this, then where can you find hope? One immigrant coming to the UK says to camera: I am sure the English will throw us a rope. A review in this newspaper described the programme as an intelligent programme likely to dispel prejudices, and it has been widely applauded for its humanity. However the response from some Romanians in the UK has been far less complimentary, with a silent protest recently held by students outside C4s offices. The ambassador complained that the programme has ignored the fact that, in their overwhelming majority, Romanians living in Britain are well integrated into the local society. He further claims that there are more than 4,000 Romanian doctors and nurses in Britain. Immigration is likely to be one of the major issues during the general election campaign. Last week an analysis from Oxford University reported that the migrant population of England had risen by 565,000 since 2011, with two-thirds coming from the EU. The figures suggest the foreign-born population of every local authority in the country may have risen. The Migration Observatory unit said it came up with the projections because similar official data will not be available before the general election. On 1 January 2014, Bulgarians and Romanians gained the same rights to work in the UK as other EU citizens. A spokesman for C4 said: This sensitively handled series confronts, head on, many of the stereotypes and widely held prejudices about Romanians coming to the UK by providing an honest account of the experience of different individuals attempting to make a life in Britain. The series makes it clear, throughout, that the majority of Romanians in the UK are professionals with guaranteed jobs who pay their taxes and contribute to the British economy."

The first of the waves that Nigel Farage and others promised, of benefit-claiming East Europeans who would engulf this green and pleasant land. Aprs him, the deluge! It was feared/politically useful to pretend they would be seeking to suckle at the bounteous teat of Britains social security system. Though it turned out that their immigration numbers actually fell after the rule change. Whatevs. There was an advert in the Daily Telegraph about them all being criminals. Placed by Nigel Farage. Yes, so I knew it was true. He has a face you cant help but trust. The ad said that 7% of all crime in the EU was carried out by Romanian gangs. 7%! No wonder he said people were right to be concerned if a group of Romanians moved in next door  imagine having only an 93% chance of not being killed by them in the night! Would it help if I told you that it was all crap? No. Tell me, how much has Spirescu managed to drain from us over the past year? He left his first job, carwashing in Biggleswade, after a day ... Aha! To float luxuriously on a sea of universal credit and housing benefit, I presume? No, because media attention made it impossible for him to stay. He went to London to work on building sites instead and now makes about 80 a day. Oh. Well, I bet hes planning to milk the system at some stage. Hes planning to go home, actually. Why? Whats wrong with here? Is his wallet toosmall for his 50s? Are all our diamond shoestoo tight? I miss my village, my life in Romania.

Victor won five Romanian league titles with Steaua, as well as the European Cup in 1986. Nicknamed Satan, he tends to wear black and his car registration number is 666. In club management, his record is modest <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><80><9c> just one league title won, and that back in 2001 with Steaua. But on each previous occasion he has managed them, Piturca has qualified Romania for a European Championship <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><80><9c> although following a disagreement with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npWJFOySK2U"" title="""">Gheorghe Hagi</a>, he was sacked before Euro 2000.</p> <h2>Piturca has not ruled out Al Ittihad move</h2> <p>Promising as the Greece game was, Pituca may not make it to Euro 2016 either. He turned down an offer to take over at the Saudi club al-Ittihad last month, but seemingly only because they refused to pay his contract-release clause and he didn<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>t want to have to pay it himself. Piturca has made little attempt to hide the frostiness of his relationship with Razvan Burleanu, the 30-year-old who was elected president of the FRF in March, the day after the favourite to land the role, Gica Popescu, was convicted of money-laundering and tax evasion and sentenced to three years in jail. Piturca has not ruled out the al-Ittihad move, saying the door to negotiation is still open. Burleanu, for his part, says he has a Plan B should Piturca go.</p> <p>He is there for now, though, and has created a stir by recalling to the team Lucian Sanmartean. He is 34 and hugely talented, but has been restricted to just seven caps largely because of his attitude. His return, though, has created great excitement, with overblown comparisons to the return of Hagi in 1999. He is likely to start as a creative midfielder, while the decision on who starts at centre-forward could also make waves. Ciprian Marica, the captain, is suspended after being sent off against Greece, meaning Piturca must choose between Bogdan Stancu, Raul Rusescu and Claudiu Keseru.</p> <p>Keseru has been in tremendous form for Steaua this season, scoring six in one game against Pandurii and a hat-trick in the Europa League against Aalborg. He is also half-Hungarian. He doesn<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>t speak Hungarian, though, and has insisted he feels entirely Romanian.</p> <p>Whether Hungarian fans, who on Wednesday released a logo proclaiming Bucharest to be <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c5><93>a Hungarian village<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c2><9d>, treat him like any other Romanian, though, remains to be seen.

The historical antipathy between the nations is understandable  rooted in on-continuing Hungarian resentment that Transylvania, which had been part of Hungary, was given to Romania as part of the Treaty of Trianon after the first world war  yet the notion of Hungarian fans as high-risk is, frankly, hard to square with the mood in Budapest in May, when I was among just over 3,000 who watched Hungary stumble to an unconvincing win over Albania in a friendly.

The only goal was a late Tamas Priskin penalty that the former Watford and Ipswich forward had won with what appeared to be a dive. That the travesty was played out in the Ferenc Puskas Stadium only made it worse: 60 years ago, Hungary lost a World Cup final they probably should have won and now, so absolute has been their collapse, their squad for Saturdays game includes only three players who play in the top 10 leagues in Europe according to Uefas coefficient. And it is fair to say that even those three  Hamburgs Zoltan Stieber, Hoffenheims Adam Szalai and Dinamo Moscows Balazs Dzsudzsak  would not have got anywhere near the Golden Squad of the 1950s. A 2-1 home defeat to Northern Ireland in their first qualifier hardly bodes well.

Vasilica is certain her son died after being given performance-enhancing drugs; she believes he was used as a guinea pig before the stimulants were given to higher-profile players. Florins cousin, Victor, was an even better footballer than he was. Victor won five Romanian league titles with Steaua, as well as the European Cup in 1986. Nicknamed Satan, he tends to wear black and his car registration number is 666. In club management, his record is modest  just one league title won, and that back in 2001 with Steaua. But on each previous occasion he has managed them, Piturca has qualified Romania for a European Championship  although following a disagreement with Gheorghe Hagi, he was sacked before Euro 2000. Promising as the Greece game was, Pituca may not make it to Euro 2016 either. He turned down an offer to take over at the Saudi club al-Ittihad last month, but seemingly only because they refused to pay his contract-release clause and he didnt want to have to pay it himself. Piturca has made little attempt to hide the frostiness of his relationship with Razvan Burleanu, the 30-year-old who was elected president of the FRF in March, the day after the favourite to land the role, Gica Popescu, was convicted of money-laundering and tax evasion and sentenced to three years in jail. Piturca has not ruled out the al-Ittihad move, saying the door to negotiation is still open. Burleanu, for his part, says he has a Plan B should Piturca go. He is there for now, though, and has created a stir by recalling to the team Lucian Sanmartean. He is 34 and hugely talented, but has been restricted to just seven caps largely because of his attitude. His return, though, has created great excitement, with overblown comparisons to the return of Hagi in 1999. He is likely to start as a creative midfielder, while the decision on who starts at centre-forward could also make waves. Ciprian Marica, the captain, is suspended after being sent off against Greece, meaning Piturca must choose between Bogdan Stancu, Raul Rusescu and Claudiu Keseru. Keseru has been in tremendous form for Steaua this season, scoring six in one game against Pandurii and a hat-trick in the Europa League against Aalborg. He is also half-Hungarian. He doesnt speak Hungarian, though, and has insisted he feels entirely Romanian. Whether Hungarian fans, who on Wednesday released a logo proclaiming Bucharest to be a Hungarian village, treat him like any other Romanian, though, remains to be seen. It promises to be feisty."

There was a metre and a half of snow on the pitch in Bucharest, he says. And it was absolutely freezing! I tell you now, in Britain no player would have cleared that snow. But they just got on with it and trained as normal. I thought to myself: This is a good bunch of lads. I can do something here. Two and a half years later, Howells initial confidence has been reinforced by results. The Romanian national team won the 2012 and 2013 IRB Nations Cup and have qualified for next years Rugby World Cup, and the Bucharest Wolves  whom he also coaches and who start their European Rugby Challenge Cup campaign in Newcastle on Friday  were good enough to beat the Italian side Calvisano twice last season and run the Falcons and Brive close. We were in front against Newcastle until the last kick of the game, says Howells, who was Graham Henrys assistant at Wales and has been a wandering minstrel ever since. And we were also within three points of Brive. So you can see the progress we have made. When you start something and see it develop its exciting. But Howells is a doughty realist. As he points out, the Wolves are a scratch squad, chosen from the eight professional sides in Romanias domestic league. Their wages  roughly 200 a month  are tiny. And the task in this years Challenge Cup is far harder as there are no Italian teams in their group, just three thoroughbreds: Stade Franais, Newport Gwent Dragons and Newcastle. You have to remember too that the Wolves are a development side, Howells says. Our team is all Romaniabased players and the primary aim is to identify players to improve the national team. So far, so good: five Romanians play Top 14 rugby in France and the full-back Catalin Fercu has signed for Saracens. Even so, shooting for the knockout stages is not so much a stretch as an impossibility, Howells says. Yet if the Bucharest winter strikes hard and early they may yet sink their teeth into a famous scalp. But the international team is a different story, he interjects. Weve recently beaten Tonga and Canada and I think well surprise a few people at the World Cup. Our big goal is to win two games, which would mean automatic qualification for the 2019 competition  that would be huge for Romania. It wont be easy: Romania start against France, then play Ireland before facing Canada and Italy. Howells is particularly looking forward to returning to Wembley for Romanias game against Ireland  his first visit since 1999, when a late Scott Gibbs try ripped the grand slam from Englands grasp. I remember Clive Woodward arrived before us and pinched the home dressing room, which should have been ours, he said with a chuckle. That didnt go down well with Graham Henry. And then in the tunnel Woodward went to the guy by the cup and said: You can put the white ribbons on that now. It was unbelievable. Has Woodward apologised for such arrogance? Of course not  but he doesnt have to, he says. My memory of that game was that we shouldnt have been in it but we were given the opportunity and we took it. The World Cup gives the emerging nations, teams such as Romania and Georgia, a place at the top table every four years but Howells says it is not enough. Though he praises the IRB for helping smaller nations, he says the gap between the haves and the rest will never inch closer when the tier-one countries award themselves most of the cash sloshing around the game. One of Howells solutions is to have promotion and relegation from the Six Nations. There is already a Six Nations B and it would only be good for the game to have a yearly play-off between the worst team in the Six Nations and the winners of the B competition, he says. We played in Georgia last year and we had a crowd of 62,000, so you cant tell me there isnt the demand. You can understand why the likes of Scotland and Italy dont want anything to do with it as they get a huge amount of money from the IRB but the fact is they are not playing well. And, on a given day if everything went our way, we could beat them. Meanwhile, those people who have bought tickets to see Romania at the Rugby World Cup  what should they expect? The level of the top players is good, Howells says. The difficulty is that our best players are all forwards. The backs have some way to go, to be honest. People have to appreciate that we are going to grind our way to tries. We are not going to be New Zealand or Australia."

We make about 65 cars an hour, 1,389 a day, says the 25-year company veteran and deputy chief of the assembly plant. Before we joined Renault we were making 110,000 cars a year here with 30,000 workers, today its 340,000 cars, with 14,000 workers. Nearby, new cars roll off the assembly line, destined for showrooms across Europe. In recent years, as other car manufacturers have lost billions of euros in sales in the aftermath of the global recession, Romanias Dacia has seen sales soar. The former communist state-owned company, bought by Renault in 1999, is Europes fastest-growing car brand, with sales on the continent rising 35% in the first six months of this year, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, fuelled by a high demand for cheap but reliable cars. Last year, in its first 12 months in the UK market, Dacia sold 17,146 cars, a record for a UK car brand launch, with its entry-level Dacia Sandero  the butt of so many Top Gear jokes  selling for 5,995. Dacias success in recent years has raised its already considerable profile in Romania: its 4.48bn (3.5bn) turnover in 2013 represented about 2.9% of the countrys GDP, with the company responsible for an estimated 130,000 jobs in Romania across its supply chain and 8% of the countrys total exports. All of which is impressive for a car brand that few in Europe had heard of until recently and that was failing badly just a decade and a half ago. Dacia has found a space in the market, it was the first to see and exploit this low-cost sector, says Tim Urquhart, principal analyst at IHS Automotive, who predicts that Dacia will sell 461,000 vehicles this year, and 604,000 by 2021. Dacia was founded in 1966, in the first years of the Ceauescu regime. It was meant to be a powerful symbol of the countrys industrial strength, named after the Dacians, the early inhabitants of the region. During the 1960s-90s, the company primarily launched licensed versions of cars such as the Renault 12, renamed the Dacia 1300. Though they were notoriously unreliable, Dacias were often the only cars on the Romanian market, so locals eventually became adept at roadside fixes. After the 1989 revolution, Dacia struggled against the tide of foreign cars entering Romania, with the brand failing to improve on outdated designs, equipment and working conditions. We didnt have heating or hot meals. I worked without heat in the winter for nine years between 1990 and 1999, says Ionela Ghenescu, 43, taking a break from her morning shift in the stamping department. Like many in Mioveni, population 32,000, the company is a family affair for Ghenescu: her husband and son also work at the factory. Most people in Mioveni work for Dacia, she says. Sitting in his office on the outskirts of Bucharest, Nicolas Maure, the French chief executive of Dacia Romania, explains Renaults decision to buy the company. Dacia had an ageing lineup and couldnt export any more. Volumes were falling and they were looking for a way to recover. At the time, Renault was considering setting up a factory in the region, to tap into the growing markets. After failing to buy Skoda in a joint bid with Volvo, Renault bought Dacia and invested 2.2bn in updating its facilities and product line. Originally the idea was to use the platform to deliver to the Romanian domestic market and central and eastern Europe. Renaults ambitious goal was to create an entry-level car for developing markets that would retail for about 5,000, and the company focused its energy on keeping costs to a minimum, while maintaining the reliability of the final product. In 2004 it launched the Dacia Logan, which retailed for about 6,400. The initial concept was perhaps a bit dull and boring, but it did the job, says Philippe Houchois, an analyst at UBS. Between September and December 2004 Dacia sold 40,000 Logans, with Romania representing 60% of sales. However, in 2005 the company started exporting to western Europe and has seen sales grow more than 10% a year since, with Romania now representing only 5% of Dacia sales, though this is also due to a weak domestic market. In the first eight months of 2014 sales of Dacia cars grew in France by 18.9%, Italy 46.4%, Germany 7.7% and Britain 69.7%, the company says, with new markets opening in Malta, Cyprus and across Scandinavia last year. Since 2004 Dacia has introduced seven new vehicles, including the Sandero, Sandero Stepway and Duster. The Dacia Duster is the number one selling car for Renault worldwide, says Maure. And Mioveni is the biggest vehicle plant for Renault in terms of output. However, there are clouds on the horizon. There is a risk of new entrants in the low-cost market, says Houchois. Dacia is quite critical to Renault  45%-50% of Renault is driven by their entry-level programme, and Renault cant believe how long its been without competition. Wages are rising in the companys Romanian facilities. This month a new round of pay negotiations is due to begin between Dacia management and the workers union. In the past, relationships have been fractious: in March 2008, workers demanded a 50% rise, finally agreeing to 28% after a 20-day walkout. In seven years, we have increased the wages threefold for blue-collar workers, says Maure. We are paying them twice as much as the average of the country; there must be a kind of slowdown on this. In recent months management has suggested that if wages cannot be kept down in Romania Dacia will be forced to move more of its operations to Morocco, where it set up a factory in 2012 to handle increasing demand. It is key for the Mioveni plant to remain competitive. One way is to keep the employment level, but to do so we have to moderate the wage increase. The other way is a combination of reducing output and greater automation. Option two would lead to thousands of job losses, says Maure, who expects it to be a difficult negotiation process. In the meantime, Dacias Romanian workers are enjoying the rebirth of their national brand. Romanians have always been proud of Dacia, says Ion Manu, 45, a maintenance worker at the Mioveni plant. He joined the company in 1987, back when Romania was still behind the Iron Curtain and Dacia cars were rarely found outside the roads of Romania. We are really proud now it is successful overseas, he says."

One of the country's leading directors and writers, Gianina Crbunariu, was represented by her documentary drama about Securitate persecution, Tipografic Majuscul, and a new fast-paced satire, Solitaritate. The latter showed just how angry Romanians themselves can be in attacking their own country  and how each target of the play (crooked politicians taking more than their fair share from the national purse, middle-class couples ill-treating their maids, populist politicians cashing in on racist sentiments) all had British parallels. If you altered a few local references, you could put this on at the National as a state-of-England play (and I sort of hope someone does). Dreaming Romania, a student piece also being shown as part of the main festival  the lack of a distinction between an international director and a student company felt truly revolutionary  offered a similarly angry critique of everything from the futility of protesting to the anarchy of social service provision. Although, performed without surtitles, the most exciting thing for the non-Romanian speaker was the semi-improvised, almost chaotic way the performers jostled for attention and talked over one another in a way that doesn't happen enough in theatre. By contrast, the piece I saw by Radu Afrim, Hai Iu Iu Nu Hey You You, was a joyous, sexy, subversive, feminist celebration of Romania's best-known folk singer, Maria Tnase (1913-63). Essentially a staged gig of power electronics and folk-inflected techno covers of her songs, it still managed to feel like a more powerful, immediate theatrical statement than the new production of Oedipus by Romania's Silviu Purcrete, which premiered at the festival. The theatre programme in Sibiu is dizzyingly packed and diverse. There is also an astonishing  and free  literary programme running alongside the festival, featuring interviews with the show's directors and critics, and offering screenings, readings and retrospectives; Neil La Bute was there doing writing workshops. Of the work I managed to get to see the first was the one piece already familiar to British audiences, Purcrete's Faust, which garnered rave reviews when it was shown at the 2009 Edinburgh festival. Faust plays every year here, as Sibiu is its home town. Alongside the Romanian work were new and not so new pieces by highly regarded international directors including the Poles Krystian Lupa (doing Thomas Bernhard) and Jan Klata (doing Strindberg), the Russian Lev Dodin (doing Schiller), and the up-and-coming German director Bastian Kraft (doing Molire). And, much though I've loved other work by many of them, it was these big guns of directors' theatre who ended up leaving me cold in each case. Instead, the real discoveries of the festival were the Czech company Handa Gote and the brilliant half-Serb, half-Croatian director, born in Bosnia, Oliver Frljic, here directing a Slovenian company in a piece about the wars in the former Yugoslavia. Handa Gote's show, Clouds, is a terrific lo-fi aesthetic in which the performer, Veronika vbov, simply tells us about her grandparents and great-grandparents. They, variously, founded the Czech communist party, were imprisoned in concentration camps, became high-ups in the secret police and were shot as traitors, which makes for a more exciting family album than most, and yet it's lightly worn and beautifully executed. Then there's Oliver Frljic and Mladinsko Theatre's Damned Be the Traitor of His Homeland, which is a choppy series of sketches, songs and dances about the role that Slovenia played during the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. It's one of the most perfect examples of theatrical alchemy I've ever seen, and its powerful, cumulative effect has the audience leaving the theatre shell-shocked, elated, angry, sad, and needing to spend some time alone. Alongside works seen at the festival, some of the best street performers and musicians from around Europe are brought in to perform around the town; this year there was an unmissable crack team of Belgian saxophonists, among others.

When he was three years old he was sent to a preschool institution in the nearby town of Com<c3><84><c6><92>ne<c3><88><e2><84><a2>ti. Here they were beaten on the soles of their feet for wetting the bed. Once, in kindergarten class, Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel tried to write the letter R and he made it wrong.

Now life got hard. The older kids beat the younger kids. Sometimes he was woken by another kid punching him in the head. He lived in a room with six other boys. They had to be ready and dressed every morning before school, standing beside their bed for inspection. For every minute they were late, they earned one whack across the palm. One of the caretakers, Celina, beat Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel a lot.

They said it was the end of history. I took my secondhand Peugeot 205 and a boyfriend and headed east. We drove to Prague, where they were selling ironic Pink Floyd The Wall T-shirts on the Charles bridge, south to Zagreb, where we laughed at the ridiculous idea of Croatian nationalism, through a place called Kosovo which we had never heard of, to Sofia where we watched a man chisel off the hammer and sickle from the facade of the parliament building.</p> <p>We spent all day stuck on the Bulgarian-Romanian border (there was a rumoured cholera epidemic) and when we finally arrived in Bucharest, it was dark and the street lamps weren<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>t working. Along the road were piles of smouldering rubbish. Of all the east European countries, with the exception of Albania, Romania had been the most closed off. It had no famous political dissidents; no Sakharovs or Wa<c3><85><e2><80><9a><c3><84><e2><84><a2>sas or Havels. Its 23 million citizens were sequestered under one of the 20th century<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s most repressive dictators: Nicolae Ceau<c3><85><c5><b8>escu.</p> <p>When he came to power in 1966, Ceau<c3><88><e2><84><a2>escu had grand plans for Romania. The country had industrialised late, after the second world war, and its birthrate was low. Ceau<c3><88><e2><84><a2>escu borrowed the 1930s Stalinist dogma that population growth would fuel economic growth and fused this idea with the conservatism of his rural childhood. In the first year of his rule, his government issued Decree 770, which outlawed abortion for women under 40 with fewer than four children. <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c5><93>The foetus is the property of the entire society,<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c2><9d> Ceau<c3><88><e2><84><a2>escu announced. <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c5><93>Anyone who avoids having children is a deserter who abandons the laws of national continuity.<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c2><9d></p> <p>The birth rate soon doubled, but then the rate of increase slowed as Romanian women resorted to homemade illegal abortions, often with catastrophic results. In 1977 all childless persons, regardless of sex or martial status, were made to pay an additional monthly tax. In the 1980s condoms and the pill, although prohibitively expensive, began to become available in Romania <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><80><9c> so they were banned altogether. Motherhood became a state duty. The system was ruthlessly enforced by the secret police, the <em>securitate</em>. Doctors who performed abortions were imprisoned, women were examined every three months in their workplaces for signs of pregnancy. If they were found to be pregnant and didn<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>t subsequently give birth, they could face prosecution. Fertility had become an instrument of state control.</p> <p>This policy, coupled with Romania<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s poverty, meant that more and more unwanted children were abandoned to state care. No one knows how many. Estimates for the number of children in orphanages in 1989 start at 100,000 and go up from there. Since the second world war, there had been a system of state institutions for children. But after 1982, when Ceau<c3><88><e2><84><a2>escu redirected most of the budget to paying off the national debt, the economy tanked and conditions in the orphanages suffered. Electricity and heat were often intermittent, there were not enough staff, there was not enough food. Physical needs were assessed, emotional needs were ignored. Doctors and professionals were denied access to foreign periodicals and research, nurses were woefully undertrained (many orphans contracted HIV because hypodermic needles were seldom sterilised) and developmental delays were routinely diagnosed as mental disability. Institutional abuse flourished unchecked. While some caretakers did their best, others stole food from the orphanage kitchens and drugged their charges into docility.</p> <p>When the revolution was over, the world<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s press discovered Ceau<c3><88><e2><84><a2>escu<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s archipelago of orphanages and the appalling images went around the world: disabled children with bone-stick limbs tied to their beds, cross-eyed toddlers who couldn<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>t walk, malnourished babies left unattended in cribs with metal bars, little corpses stacked in basements. The pictures shocked Romanians as much as they did the rest of the world; institutionalised children were generally kept away from the general population.</p> <p>When I arrived in my little Peugeot that summer, eight months after Europe<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s only violent revolution, there were still bullet holes around the national TV station building. On Christmas Day 1989, Ceau<c3><85><c5><b8>escu and his wife Elena had been tried in an empty school house and shot the same day. Ion Iliescu, a communist opponent of Ceau<c3><88><e2><84><a2>escu<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s, had been elected president in May.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""d66516349bc89a7d3a576dc2b234b686cc2dfde5""> <img src=""https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/9/1418144714561/c8d53e58-f5e7-48b6-bc87-6e027a0a000b-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""The palace built by Nicolae Ceau<c3><88><e2><84><a2>escu"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">The palace built by Nicolae Ceau<c3><88><e2><84><a2>escu is now the largest civil administration building in the world.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Michel Euler/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One night we bribed a guard with a packet of cigarettes for a tour of Ceau<c3><88><e2><84><a2>escu<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s palace, nominally the House of the People. Ceau<c3><88><e2><84><a2>escu never lived to see it completed, but its monstrous proportions were clear: huge vaulted rooms, marble staircases big enough for giants, chandeliers the size of small cars. One day we went to an orphanage. There were 15 or more babies lying in cribs in one room. I picked one up. He was small and thin and had big, satellite-wide blue eyes in a head that seemed too heavy for him to hold up. The nurse told me he was a year old.</p> <p>This autumn I went back to Bucharest for the first time. Ceau<c3><88><e2><84><a2>escu<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s palace has been turned into the national parliament which only manages to fill a part of the edifice. The facade is neoclassical bland-grand, from a distance it looks like a squat toad sitting on a hill. The new government never built the roof that they had planned, so the last story ends in an abrupt flat line. Its sheer size is still overwhelming <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><80><9c> it is the largest civil administration building in the world <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><80><9c> but the palace has weathered over the past 25 years. I remembered a sparkling white behemoth of ego in the middle of a benighted country, now it just seems part of the landscape, subsumed to democracy.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>After running away from his placement centre in Com<c3><84><c6><92>ne<c3><88><e2><84><a2>ti, Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel grew up to spend his teenage years in one of the smaller homes that, during the 1990s, began to replace the giant placement centres. Since the fall of Ceau<c3><85><c5><b8>escu, Romania has come a long way in overhauling its child protection system. As Sandie Blanchet, the Unicef representative in Romania, told me: <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c5><93>The ideology under Ceau<c3><88><e2><84><a2>escu<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s regime was that the state was better than the family. Nobody is saying that now.<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c2><9d> Today only a third of Romania<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s children in the state system are housed in residential homes maintained by the state. Half of these are in what are known as <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c5><93>family-type<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c2><9d> homes with five or six kids growing up together. The other half are in placement centres, larger institutional buildings that usually house between 30 and 100 kids. However, the majority of Romanian children in the state system are in foster care <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><80><9c> Romanian foster parents are paid a salary from the state, rather than being subsidised volunteers as they are in western European countries <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><80><9c> or placed with extended family. The government has made a public commitment to close all the remaining placement centres <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><80><9c> roughly 170 <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><80><9c> by 2020.</p> <p>But this progress conceals an ongoing problem; just as in Ceau<c3><85><c5><b8>escu<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s time, most of these children are not orphans, they are in fact <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c5><93>separated from their parents<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c2><9d>. The number of Romanian children separated from their parents has fallen from an estimated 100,000 in 1990 to some 60,000 today. But the birth rate has also steeply declined, which means that the proportion of Romania<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s children in state care has remained stubbornly high. Things have improved little since the 1990s. And parents are still abandoning their children, largely it turns out, for the same reason as in previous decades: poverty.</p> <p>Romania is the poorest country per capita in the European Union and spends among the least on social welfare. When it joined the EU in 2007, many citizens thought the country would quickly become as rich as France or Germany. Instead the global economic crisis hit Romania late, in 2010, but hard. Budgets were slashed, wages cut. In 2011, for the first time in 15 years, the number of children in state care actually increased. A caregiver in the child protection system now earns between <c3><a2><e2><80><9a><c2><ac>200 and <c3><a2><e2><80><9a><c2><ac>250 a month, less than they did five years ago.</p> <p>Bucharest looks bustling and prosperous; a new metro extension is being built. But half of Romanians live in the countryside, in villages that often lack basic services. Schools operate in shifts, morning for the primary schools pupils, afternoons for secondary school. <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c5><93>There is a huge problem with poverty,<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c2><9d> said Mirela Oprea, the secretary general of Childpact, a regional coalition of child protection NGOs. <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c5><93>In rural Romania girls don<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>t have enough information about contraception, education is very limited, they drop out of school very early.<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c2><9d> Under the communist authorities police would visit parents of truants, now <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c5><93>no one comes to enforce the law<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c2><9d>. The government gives a regular stipend to parents of children under two, but when this ends, children are often abandoned.</p> <h2><br>* * *</h2>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote""> <blockquote> <p>The ideology under Ceau<c3><88><e2><84><a2>escu<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s regime was that the state was better than the family. Nobody is saying that now</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the early 1990s western charities and NGOs rushed in to Romania with supplies of blankets, powdered milk and toys. Many children were scooped up by western parents in a rescue-adoption frenzy. Orphanages got basic necessities, but the culture remained unchanged. The importance of play, of interaction and communication, of care, was not yet understood.</p> <p>Along with western money came psychologists and behavioural scientists. Romania<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s neglected children represented a tragic experiment in what happens to institutionalised children denied the stimulation of normal human relationships. Michael Rutter, the UK<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s first professor of child psychology, discovered that the time it took for the children to catch up to their peer group in terms of development, was relative to the amount of time spent in an institution.</p> <p>Today, nothing about Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s demeanour suggests an institutional childhood. In the time I spent with him, he was open, gregarious and optimistic. He told me that often when he talked to teenagers in the system they didn<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>t believe he had grown up like them. His NGO has 35 volunteers, who work on various programmes, from taking kids on outings to playing laser tag to organising seminars to teach teenagers life skills. I visited him at the apartment in Bucharest which he shares with his older brother Virgil. Virgil, like Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel, had grown up in institutions and managed to go on to university, where he had studied psychology. He and Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel had founded the NGO together and on their apartment wall was the logo, a stylised pair of open arms linked to a heart, surrounded by hundreds of multicoloured children<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s handprints. <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c5><93>We used to have lots of kids come over,<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c2><9d> said Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel, <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c5><93>but the neighbours complained about the noise.<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c2><9d></p> <p>Most of Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s work with his NGO focuses on teenagers in placement centres and family-type apartments. Some districts of Bucharest were more receptive than others. He has good relations with some administrators and educators, as caregivers are known; others see him as a troublemaker, giving the kids false hope.</p> <p>Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel took me with him when he went to visit caregivers to discuss how his NGO could help. We visited a family-type apartment, which was like most that I saw: an ordinary flat in a housing block, three children to a room in which the beds take up almost all the floor space. The educators, usually women, rotate in shifts, cooking Romanian staples such as stuffed cabbage and soup, taking kids to school, helping with homework. The children were warm and fed and cared for. But, as Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel explained, they often grow up without possessions and without a sense of ownership. They have little agency in their lives and they suffer from a crippling lack of self-esteem.</p>  <aside class=""element element-pullquote""> <blockquote> <p>Parents are still abandoning their children, largely it turns out, for the same reason as in previous decades: poverty</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At a conference we attended in Bucharest about how to help young people who are leaving the system, Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel and I listened as two speakers complained that teenagers often had unrealistically high expectations; they received the very best the Romanian state could give them and they should be doing much better, the problem was that they did not have any sense of responsibility because they were used to having everything done for them. Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel was angry at their attitude; these were the people who should be encouraging the kids in their care, he told me, not disparaging them.</p> <p>One afternoon we went to an emergency placement centre in a poor Roma area of Bucharest; car repair shops, crumbling housing blocks and garbage drifts. The centre was housed in an old school, set back from the road behind a 10ft solid metal fence. A three-legged dog hopped around the entrance. Inside, Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel talked to the director, a jolly, square-shaped woman, who talked volubly about all the things the 40 or so children in her charge centre had: a chess club, folk dancing lessons and plans for a new football pitch. But, she lamented, everything they had came from donations. The government money was not enough even to buy clothes for the children.</p> <p>The director took us on a tour. The facility had recently been refurbished. It was clean and functional, but empty and depressing. A wide corridor led off to small rooms with bunk beds. A teenage girl tapped into a mobile phone at a desk. (Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel told me later that girls in placement centres were sometimes given mobile phones by pimp boyfriends so they could earn money doing sex chats online.) The director proudly unlocked a room full of donated computers. Once a week the children had a lesson on computers, but no, the rest of the time they were not allowed to use them.</p> <p>Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel shook his head as we left. It had snowed the day before and the wind was cold and raw. <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c5><93>I promise you it was even worse when I saw it a year ago,<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c2><9d> he said.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s teenage years were rescued by the chance discovery when he was 11 that two of the cadet soldiers billeted in his placement centre for the summer had the same surname as him. They were, in fact, his brothers. They told him that he had other brothers and sisters and that he had parents too. That summer they took him to meet them. Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel learned that he was the last of 13 children. His mother was mad and his father beat her. Four of their children died. The rest had gone into the system. He met his mother for the first time that summer. The first time he saw her she was walking down a hill throwing stones at dogs. His father was asleep in the yard in front of a collapsed hut, and couldn<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>t remember anyone called Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel and then tried to make a joke about it. Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel didn<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>t know what to say or what to feel. There was a donkey braying in the adjacent field and he went over and petted it.</p> <p>He found a better reception with his brother Virgil. Virgil was 10 years older than Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel. When Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel first met him Virgil was 21 and living with an old Armenian professor, who had unofficially adopted him, in the forest spa town of Targu Ocna. Virgil had grown up there during the 1980s in one of the worst orphanages. <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c5><93>We were 1,100 kids,<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c2><9d> he told me when I met him. <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c5><93>We were like ants.<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c2><9d> Virgil was small, with a thin, concave frame. He said there had been a lot of violence between the older kids and the younger ones. I asked him for an example. He was silent for a moment.</p> <p><c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c5><93>Emotionally, it<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s very difficult,<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c2><9d> he said. He held one thin arm across his chest, clinging on to his wrist. Like Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel he preferred to talk in generalities. It was painful to retrace specific episodes. <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c5><93>The principle was [that] the strongest were the leaders. If you tried to ask for help from a caretaker, the caretaker would punish the boy who had hit you and then he would just come back and abuse you worse. So the second time you wouldn<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>t tell. You repressed everything you felt.<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c2><9d></p> <h2>* * *<br></h2> <p>As much as the revolution against Ceau<c3><85><c5><b8>escu was a popular uprising, it was also a palace coup. There was an overlap between the old regime and the new government <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><80><9c> securitate members got rich, functionaries in ministries continued to be self-serving and incompetent. <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c5><93>Romania lost a decade,<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c2><9d> a prominent magazine editor in Bucharest told me. Things began to change in 1997, when Emil Constantinescu replaced Iliescu (although Iliescu would be elected again, serving from 2000-2004). Constantinescu ushered in a period of greater reform. His government established a new Child Protection Authority, promoted the <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c5><93>family-type<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c2><9d> apartments and introduced foster care, which had never existed in Romania. The EU made reform one of the explicit conditions of Romania joining, and spent money on training foster parents and renovating accommodation for children in care. Mirela Oprea remembered the impact of the EU<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s declaration that membership would be tied to the way Romania treated its abandoned children. <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c5><93>You cannot imagine the huge pressure created by such a statement,<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c2><9d> she told me. <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c5><93>It became a political issue. There was something amazing about this that still gives me goosebumps.<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c2><9d></p> <p>Professionals working in Romanian child protection who I spoke to often stressed that the next step would be to implement a comprehensive welfare system that would prevent many children from falling into the state system. Sandie Blanchet told me that Unicef is now working with the government to test run a programme that would put social workers in villages. They would try to reach vulnerable families, helping them with medical care, administrative tasks such as getting birth certificates, and issues such as violence and alcoholism. <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c5><93>This is what we have in western Europe and we don<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>t even notice,<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c2><9d> said Blanchet. Funds for the scheme were coming from the EU.</p> <p>In many ways Romania is a poster child for EU expansion. More than once Romanians I talked to shuddered at the example of neighbouring Ukraine, corrupt and suffering civil war, caught in the Russian sphere of influence. Despite the nation<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s poverty, things look a little better in Romania. Corruption, once endemic, is now being checked. Over the past few years more than 1,000 officials have been indicted; a former prime minister, Adrian Nastase, is in jail. Romania now has a lower rate of children separated from their parents in state care than Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>One blustery blue-grey afternoon we drove out of Bucharest, five hours along a single-carriage highway through a flat plain, north towards the Carpathians. Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel wanted to take me back to the sites of his childhood. Horse-drawn carts, piled with silage and chopped wood, slowed the traffic. Peasants gleaned corn in black furrowed fields. We passed through villages in which half the houses were collapsing under carved gingerbread eaves and the other half had new polyurethane roofs, often paid for by remittances of Romanians working abroad.</p> <p>In the centre of the small town of Com<c3><84><c6><92>ne<c3><88><e2><84><a2>ti, where Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel spent much of his childhood, was the hulk of a closed down factory. An oil pipeline ran alongside the road, propped up on crumbling concrete supports and wrapped in tar paper bandages. We drove into the town and through quiet streets.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""cfbc4e03267e145c293acd508de597459bc7a031""> <img src=""https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/12/9/1418143337594/093eda1a-741c-4f62-9bac-a8f1681849d5-460x276.jpeg"" alt=""Visinel Balan"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel Balan lived in a railway station off and on from the age of nine.</span> <span class=""element-image__credit"">Photograph: Andrei Pungovschi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Com<c3><84><c6><92>ne<c3><88><e2><84><a2>ti, Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel and I found the train station where he had lived when he was on the streets when he was 11, a handsome building with Ottoman yellow and blue tiles around the windowsills. In the forecourt had been a ramshackle bar where Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel cleaned up for money. Other times he washed cars at a garage a few blocks away or worked for tips as a porter at the market.</p> <p><c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c5><93>This is the fountain where I washed,<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c2><9d> said Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel, tour guide for his own past, <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c5><93>here is the waiting room where I slept <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c2><a6><c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c2><9d> Cold stone floor; missing window panes. <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c5><93>This was my corner,<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c2><9d> he said and pointed to a metal baggage cart. <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c5><93>I liked to sleep on that exact baggage cart. I can<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>t believe its still here. Many of my colleagues were raped or killed at the train station. These things happened. I remember the cemetery where we buried one of the girls. We used to train-hop together and a man tried to rape her and she resisted and he killed her. I was 10 and she was only a little older.<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c2><9d> Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel spoke in an understated rush, as if he was constantly testing the limits of what he wanted to remember. I didn<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>t feel I could push him for more details.</p> <p>Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel spent several months going back and forth between the train station and Placement Centre Number 6. He finally ran away again, this time taking refuge in a monastery in the woods a few kilometres from Com<c3><84><c6><92>ne<c3><88><e2><84><a2>ti. He lied about where he<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>d come from and how he got the bruises on his back. The priest let him stay if he worked for his board by chopping wood. Although he says that the nuns chopped the wood for him <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><80><9c> <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c5><93>the axe was as big as I was!<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c2><9d> <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><80><9c> and let him take the credit. When he made contact again with the authorities, Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel was placed with a foster family who had a farm in the area. The husband beat the wife and the wife beat Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel. He lived there for two years. He complained to the authorities and was told to stop making trouble. He kept complaining until they took him out of the foster home and put him in a family-type apartment in Bac<c3><84><c6><92>u. He kept complaining until the foster couple were taken off the foster register.</p> <p>He had gained confidence by getting to know his older brothers, elder boys who could protect him and help him. He now saw that he had some control over his own destiny.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>This autumn, Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel was in the process of organising a conference for teenagers and had invited other success stories from the system, including a fighter pilot and a civil servant, to talk about their experiences. His conference was titled My Story but Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel was not going to tell his. I tried to tease him about this paradox. He shook his head. <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c5><93>I like to listen to other people<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s stories, not necessarily to speak myself.<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c2><9d></p> <p>Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel is an unusual success story. He went to university and remained legally under state care until last year, when he was 26 years old, the maximum age the state will support a young person if they are in higher education. But his success was his own.</p> <p>He was intelligent and engaging and cute. From a young age he understood that these were tools for survival, attributes that would attract adults who could help him. In his teens Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel became active in local politics, joining the local youth wing of a liberal political party in Bac<c3><84><c6><92>u. A local councillor called Codrin Lungu befriended him and helped to get him into a better high school so that he could take his university entrance exams. Near his school lived Constantin Prihoanc<c3><84><c6><92> and his wife, a retired childless couple who had become foster parents to several children. Their cosy apartment became a place of respite on winter evenings. Here Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel found a home.</p> <p>He took me to see them in their apartment in Bac<c3><84><c6><92>u, a town of grey blocks and collapsing villas. Constantin was now retired but had been, in Ceau<c3><85><c5><b8>escu<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s time, <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c5><93>an ordinary worker<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c2><9d>, as he put it. He thought life was better under communism because back then everyone was equal, everyone had a job and an apartment. He was for the socialist party; Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel was for the liberals and they discussed the upcoming presidential election as we sat in the little kitchen and ate the hot soup his wife had made.

He was drunk, hobbling with a stiff, dragged-along gait. He was holding a cup of McDonald<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s coffee and cadging a cigarette from the security guard. His head seemed too large for his small body. The security guard knew him: he had been in the placement centre, now closed, just across the street, as a child. He was 35; although he looked 50.

It was also clear that his pain and trauma hovered very close to the surface. More than once his expression went rigid, his throat closed and he stopped talking and left the room so as not to cry in front of me. He told me that part of the reason he had studied acting was to learn <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c5><93>how to control emotions, how to understand yourself better and other people around you, relationships.

As we drove on, the road turned into a rocky track, wound up the slope of a pretty, wooded valley, thin streams of smoke rising from stove pipes, ducks in puddles. It was close to dusk. We stopped in front of the shack where Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel had first met his father. It was impossible to imagine anyone had ever lived there, it was a ruin. A couple of years ago Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel had convinced the mayor to build his mother a new house, next door. It was a single room made of breeze blocks, with a tin roof and no running water or electricity.</p> <p>Vi<c3><85><c5><b8>inel walked up the sloped yard, overgrown with weeds and strewn with rubbish, and called out her name: <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c5><93>Ileana!

An old woman appeared, wearing a shapeless skirt and a heavy men<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s suit jacket. A blue headscarf was tied under her chin but wisps of wild white hair escaped it. She was barefoot. She talked in a torrent of disconnected thoughts.

It was August 1987. At the entrance to the institution there was a poster of a mother bringing in her baby, then walking away with her child, now older, hand in hand. The message was: the state can take better care of your child than you can.  Related: Ceausescus children. By Wendell Steavenson  Viinels earliest memories are of rocking himself backwards and forwards and of waking up warm, wet with pee. When he was three years old he was sent to a preschool institution in the nearby town of Comneti. Here they were beaten on the soles of their feet for wetting the bed. Once, in kindergarten class, Viinel tried to write the letter R and he made it wrong. He went to the cupboard, took an eraser to rub it out and put the eraser in his pocket. One of the other kids told on him and the caretaker stripped his clothes off and held him over the desk and beat his bottom with a stick. Still, Viinel was lucky. He was cute, blond and blue-eyed, and often sick with bronchitis or pneumonia. He attracted the attention of the staff. One of the caretakers made a pet of him and brought him extra biscuits, which he hid under his pillow. When he was eight years old, Viinel was moved to Placement Centre Number 6 in Comneti. Now life got hard. The older kids beat the younger kids. Sometimes he was woken by another kid punching him in the head. He lived in a room with six other boys. They had to be ready and dressed every morning before school, standing beside their bed for inspection. For every minute they were late, they earned one whack across the palm. One of the caretakers, Celina, beat Viinel a lot. A year after he arrived at the placement centre, Viinel jumped from the second-storey balcony and ran away to live in the railway station. Its important to remember, grownup Viinel told me, sitting in a brightly lit cafe in Bucharest, with a slice of cake in front of him, that I didnt know anything about my family until I was 11 years old. When I first met Viinel he was wearing a checked shirt and green jeans and green trainers. His favourite colour is green. His face is handsome, open and boyish. Viinel is now 27. He has a law degree and a theatre degree, and has just begun a masters in psychology at the University of Bucharest. He has worked as a project coordinator for the Ministry of Youth and Sport, as a drama teacher at a school for gifted children and as a consultant for Saatchi & Saatchi in Romania. He has bought a car and a small apartment in a pretty village outside Bucharest. The thing he is most proud of, however, is the NGO he co-founded in 2013. Drawing Your Own Future works with children in Romanias child-protection system. Viinel said he wanted to show teenagers that they could master their own destinies, as he had. I am looking at you and I am thinking about this sickly, beaten nine-year-old begging on the streets and I cant put the two together, I said. Were you a different person back then? Viinels face went blank for a moment, his smile stopped. He raised his chin and looked up at the ceiling, and when he lowered it again I saw that his eyes were filled with tears. The tears spilled and ran silently down his cheeks. He said, almost in a whisper: It is the same person. In the summer of 1990 I was 19, revolutions had recently swept the communists from eastern Europe, the world was new and everything was possible. They said it was the end of history. I took my secondhand Peugeot 205 and a boyfriend and headed east. We drove to Prague, where they were selling ironic Pink Floyd The Wall T-shirts on the Charles bridge, south to Zagreb, where we laughed at the ridiculous idea of Croatian nationalism, through a place called Kosovo which we had never heard of, to Sofia where we watched a man chisel off the hammer and sickle from the facade of the parliament building. We spent all day stuck on the Bulgarian-Romanian border (there was a rumoured cholera epidemic) and when we finally arrived in Bucharest, it was dark and the street lamps werent working. Along the road were piles of smouldering rubbish. Of all the east European countries, with the exception of Albania, Romania had been the most closed off. It had no famous political dissidents; no Sakharovs or Wasas or Havels. Its 23 million citizens were sequestered under one of the 20th centurys most repressive dictators: Nicolae Ceauescu. When he came to power in 1966, Ceauescu had grand plans for Romania. The country had industrialised late, after the second world war, and its birthrate was low. Ceauescu borrowed the 1930s Stalinist dogma that population growth would fuel economic growth and fused this idea with the conservatism of his rural childhood. In the first year of his rule, his government issued Decree 770, which outlawed abortion for women under 40 with fewer than four children. The foetus is the property of the entire society, Ceauescu announced. Anyone who avoids having children is a deserter who abandons the laws of national continuity. The birth rate soon doubled, but then the rate of increase slowed as Romanian women resorted to homemade illegal abortions, often with catastrophic results. In 1977 all childless persons, regardless of sex or martial status, were made to pay an additional monthly tax. In the 1980s condoms and the pill, although prohibitively expensive, began to become available in Romania  so they were banned altogether. Motherhood became a state duty. The system was ruthlessly enforced by the secret police, the securitate. Doctors who performed abortions were imprisoned, women were examined every three months in their workplaces for signs of pregnancy. If they were found to be pregnant and didnt subsequently give birth, they could face prosecution. Fertility had become an instrument of state control. This policy, coupled with Romanias poverty, meant that more and more unwanted children were abandoned to state care. No one knows how many. Estimates for the number of children in orphanages in 1989 start at 100,000 and go up from there. Since the second world war, there had been a system of state institutions for children. But after 1982, when Ceauescu redirected most of the budget to paying off the national debt, the economy tanked and conditions in the orphanages suffered. Electricity and heat were often intermittent, there were not enough staff, there was not enough food. Physical needs were assessed, emotional needs were ignored. Doctors and professionals were denied access to foreign periodicals and research, nurses were woefully undertrained (many orphans contracted HIV because hypodermic needles were seldom sterilised) and developmental delays were routinely diagnosed as mental disability. Institutional abuse flourished unchecked. While some caretakers did their best, others stole food from the orphanage kitchens and drugged their charges into docility. When the revolution was over, the worlds press discovered Ceauescus archipelago of orphanages and the appalling images went around the world: disabled children with bone-stick limbs tied to their beds, cross-eyed toddlers who couldnt walk, malnourished babies left unattended in cribs with metal bars, little corpses stacked in basements. The pictures shocked Romanians as much as they did the rest of the world; institutionalised children were generally kept away from the general population. When I arrived in my little Peugeot that summer, eight months after Europes only violent revolution, there were still bullet holes around the national TV station building. On Christmas Day 1989, Ceauescu and his wife Elena had been tried in an empty school house and shot the same day. Ion Iliescu, a communist opponent of Ceauescus, had been elected president in May. One night we bribed a guard with a packet of cigarettes for a tour of Ceauescus palace, nominally the House of the People. Ceauescu never lived to see it completed, but its monstrous proportions were clear: huge vaulted rooms, marble staircases big enough for giants, chandeliers the size of small cars. One day we went to an orphanage. There were 15 or more babies lying in cribs in one room. I picked one up. He was small and thin and had big, satellite-wide blue eyes in a head that seemed too heavy for him to hold up. The nurse told me he was a year old. This autumn I went back to Bucharest for the first time. Ceauescus palace has been turned into the national parliament which only manages to fill a part of the edifice. The facade is neoclassical bland-grand, from a distance it looks like a squat toad sitting on a hill. The new government never built the roof that they had planned, so the last story ends in an abrupt flat line. Its sheer size is still overwhelming  it is the largest civil administration building in the world  but the palace has weathered over the past 25 years. I remembered a sparkling white behemoth of ego in the middle of a benighted country, now it just seems part of the landscape, subsumed to democracy. After running away from his placement centre in Comneti, Viinel grew up to spend his teenage years in one of the smaller homes that, during the 1990s, began to replace the giant placement centres. Since the fall of Ceauescu, Romania has come a long way in overhauling its child protection system. As Sandie Blanchet, the Unicef representative in Romania, told me: The ideology under Ceauescus regime was that the state was better than the family. Nobody is saying that now. Today only a third of Romanias children in the state system are housed in residential homes maintained by the state. Half of these are in what are known as family-type homes with five or six kids growing up together. The other half are in placement centres, larger institutional buildings that usually house between 30 and 100 kids. However, the majority of Romanian children in the state system are in foster care  Romanian foster parents are paid a salary from the state, rather than being subsidised volunteers as they are in western European countries  or placed with extended family. The government has made a public commitment to close all the remaining placement centres  roughly 170  by 2020. But this progress conceals an ongoing problem; just as in Ceauescus time, most of these children are not orphans, they are in fact separated from their parents. The number of Romanian children separated from their parents has fallen from an estimated 100,000 in 1990 to some 60,000 today. But the birth rate has also steeply declined, which means that the proportion of Romanias children in state care has remained stubbornly high. Things have improved little since the 1990s. And parents are still abandoning their children, largely it turns out, for the same reason as in previous decades: poverty. Romania is the poorest country per capita in the European Union and spends among the least on social welfare. When it joined the EU in 2007, many citizens thought the country would quickly become as rich as France or Germany. Instead the global economic crisis hit Romania late, in 2010, but hard. Budgets were slashed, wages cut. In 2011, for the first time in 15 years, the number of children in state care actually increased. A caregiver in the child protection system now earns between 200 and 250 a month, less than they did five years ago. Bucharest looks bustling and prosperous; a new metro extension is being built. But half of Romanians live in the countryside, in villages that often lack basic services. Schools operate in shifts, morning for the primary schools pupils, afternoons for secondary school. There is a huge problem with poverty, said Mirela Oprea, the secretary general of Childpact, a regional coalition of child protection NGOs. In rural Romania girls dont have enough information about contraception, education is very limited, they drop out of school very early. Under the communist authorities police would visit parents of truants, now no one comes to enforce the law. The government gives a regular stipend to parents of children under two, but when this ends, children are often abandoned. The ideology under Ceauescus regime was that the state was better than the family. Nobody is saying that now In the early 1990s western charities and NGOs rushed in to Romania with supplies of blankets, powdered milk and toys. Many children were scooped up by western parents in a rescue-adoption frenzy. Orphanages got basic necessities, but the culture remained unchanged. The importance of play, of interaction and communication, of care, was not yet understood. Along with western money came psychologists and behavioural scientists. Romanias neglected children represented a tragic experiment in what happens to institutionalised children denied the stimulation of normal human relationships. Michael Rutter, the UKs first professor of child psychology, discovered that the time it took for the children to catch up to their peer group in terms of development, was relative to the amount of time spent in an institution. Today, nothing about Viinels demeanour suggests an institutional childhood. In the time I spent with him, he was open, gregarious and optimistic. He told me that often when he talked to teenagers in the system they didnt believe he had grown up like them. His NGO has 35 volunteers, who work on various programmes, from taking kids on outings to playing laser tag to organising seminars to teach teenagers life skills. I visited him at the apartment in Bucharest which he shares with his older brother Virgil. Virgil, like Viinel, had grown up in institutions and managed to go on to university, where he had studied psychology. He and Viinel had founded the NGO together and on their apartment wall was the logo, a stylised pair of open arms linked to a heart, surrounded by hundreds of multicoloured childrens handprints. We used to have lots of kids come over, said Viinel, but the neighbours complained about the noise. Most of Viinels work with his NGO focuses on teenagers in placement centres and family-type apartments. Some districts of Bucharest were more receptive than others. He has good relations with some administrators and educators, as caregivers are known; others see him as a troublemaker, giving the kids false hope. Viinel took me with him when he went to visit caregivers to discuss how his NGO could help. We visited a family-type apartment, which was like most that I saw: an ordinary flat in a housing block, three children to a room in which the beds take up almost all the floor space. The educators, usually women, rotate in shifts, cooking Romanian staples such as stuffed cabbage and soup, taking kids to school, helping with homework. The children were warm and fed and cared for. But, as Viinel explained, they often grow up without possessions and without a sense of ownership. They have little agency in their lives and they suffer from a crippling lack of self-esteem. Parents are still abandoning their children, largely it turns out, for the same reason as in previous decades: poverty At a conference we attended in Bucharest about how to help young people who are leaving the system, Viinel and I listened as two speakers complained that teenagers often had unrealistically high expectations; they received the very best the Romanian state could give them and they should be doing much better, the problem was that they did not have any sense of responsibility because they were used to having everything done for them. Viinel was angry at their attitude; these were the people who should be encouraging the kids in their care, he told me, not disparaging them. One afternoon we went to an emergency placement centre in a poor Roma area of Bucharest; car repair shops, crumbling housing blocks and garbage drifts. The centre was housed in an old school, set back from the road behind a 10ft solid metal fence. A three-legged dog hopped around the entrance. Inside, Viinel talked to the director, a jolly, square-shaped woman, who talked volubly about all the things the 40 or so children in her charge centre had: a chess club, folk dancing lessons and plans for a new football pitch. But, she lamented, everything they had came from donations. The government money was not enough even to buy clothes for the children. The director took us on a tour. The facility had recently been refurbished. It was clean and functional, but empty and depressing. A wide corridor led off to small rooms with bunk beds. A teenage girl tapped into a mobile phone at a desk. (Viinel told me later that girls in placement centres were sometimes given mobile phones by pimp boyfriends so they could earn money doing sex chats online.) The director proudly unlocked a room full of donated computers. Once a week the children had a lesson on computers, but no, the rest of the time they were not allowed to use them. Viinel shook his head as we left. It had snowed the day before and the wind was cold and raw. I promise you it was even worse when I saw it a year ago, he said. Viinels teenage years were rescued by the chance discovery when he was 11 that two of the cadet soldiers billeted in his placement centre for the summer had the same surname as him. They were, in fact, his brothers. They told him that he had other brothers and sisters and that he had parents too. That summer they took him to meet them. Viinel learned that he was the last of 13 children. His mother was mad and his father beat her. Four of their children died. The rest had gone into the system. He met his mother for the first time that summer. The first time he saw her she was walking down a hill throwing stones at dogs. His father was asleep in the yard in front of a collapsed hut, and couldnt remember anyone called Viinel and then tried to make a joke about it. Viinel didnt know what to say or what to feel. There was a donkey braying in the adjacent field and he went over and petted it. He found a better reception with his brother Virgil. Virgil was 10 years older than Viinel. When Viinel first met him Virgil was 21 and living with an old Armenian professor, who had unofficially adopted him, in the forest spa town of Targu Ocna. Virgil had grown up there during the 1980s in one of the worst orphanages. We were 1,100 kids, he told me when I met him. We were like ants. Virgil was small, with a thin, concave frame. He said there had been a lot of violence between the older kids and the younger ones. I asked him for an example. He was silent for a moment. Emotionally, its very difficult, he said. He held one thin arm across his chest, clinging on to his wrist. Like Viinel he preferred to talk in generalities. It was painful to retrace specific episodes. The principle was [that] the strongest were the leaders. If you tried to ask for help from a caretaker, the caretaker would punish the boy who had hit you and then he would just come back and abuse you worse. So the second time you wouldnt tell. You repressed everything you felt. As much as the revolution against Ceauescu was a popular uprising, it was also a palace coup. There was an overlap between the old regime and the new government  securitate members got rich, functionaries in ministries continued to be self-serving and incompetent. Romania lost a decade, a prominent magazine editor in Bucharest told me. Things began to change in 1997, when Emil Constantinescu replaced Iliescu (although Iliescu would be elected again, serving from 2000-2004). Constantinescu ushered in a period of greater reform. His government established a new Child Protection Authority, promoted the family-type apartments and introduced foster care, which had never existed in Romania. The EU made reform one of the explicit conditions of Romania joining, and spent money on training foster parents and renovating accommodation for children in care. Mirela Oprea remembered the impact of the EUs declaration that membership would be tied to the way Romania treated its abandoned children. You cannot imagine the huge pressure created by such a statement, she told me. It became a political issue. There was something amazing about this that still gives me goosebumps. Professionals working in Romanian child protection who I spoke to often stressed that the next step would be to implement a comprehensive welfare system that would prevent many children from falling into the state system. Sandie Blanchet told me that Unicef is now working with the government to test run a programme that would put social workers in villages. They would try to reach vulnerable families, helping them with medical care, administrative tasks such as getting birth certificates, and issues such as violence and alcoholism. This is what we have in western Europe and we dont even notice, said Blanchet. Funds for the scheme were coming from the EU. In many ways Romania is a poster child for EU expansion. More than once Romanians I talked to shuddered at the example of neighbouring Ukraine, corrupt and suffering civil war, caught in the Russian sphere of influence. Despite the nations poverty, things look a little better in Romania. Corruption, once endemic, is now being checked. Over the past few years more than 1,000 officials have been indicted; a former prime minister, Adrian Nastase, is in jail. Romania now has a lower rate of children separated from their parents in state care than Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. One blustery blue-grey afternoon we drove out of Bucharest, five hours along a single-carriage highway through a flat plain, north towards the Carpathians. Viinel wanted to take me back to the sites of his childhood. Horse-drawn carts, piled with silage and chopped wood, slowed the traffic. Peasants gleaned corn in black furrowed fields. We passed through villages in which half the houses were collapsing under carved gingerbread eaves and the other half had new polyurethane roofs, often paid for by remittances of Romanians working abroad. In the centre of the small town of Comneti, where Viinel spent much of his childhood, was the hulk of a closed down factory. An oil pipeline ran alongside the road, propped up on crumbling concrete supports and wrapped in tar paper bandages. We drove into the town and through quiet streets. In Comneti, Viinel and I found the train station where he had lived when he was on the streets when he was 11, a handsome building with Ottoman yellow and blue tiles around the windowsills. In the forecourt had been a ramshackle bar where Viinel cleaned up for money. Other times he washed cars at a garage a few blocks away or worked for tips as a porter at the market. This is the fountain where I washed, said Viinel, tour guide for his own past, here is the waiting room where I slept  Cold stone floor; missing window panes. This was my corner, he said and pointed to a metal baggage cart. I liked to sleep on that exact baggage cart. I cant believe its still here. Many of my colleagues were raped or killed at the train station. These things happened. I remember the cemetery where we buried one of the girls. We used to train-hop together and a man tried to rape her and she resisted and he killed her. I was 10 and she was only a little older. Viinel spoke in an understated rush, as if he was constantly testing the limits of what he wanted to remember. I didnt feel I could push him for more details. Viinel spent several months going back and forth between the train station and Placement Centre Number 6. He finally ran away again, this time taking refuge in a monastery in the woods a few kilometres from Comneti. He lied about where hed come from and how he got the bruises on his back. The priest let him stay if he worked for his board by chopping wood. Although he says that the nuns chopped the wood for him  the axe was as big as I was!  and let him take the credit. When he made contact again with the authorities, Viinel was placed with a foster family who had a farm in the area. The husband beat the wife and the wife beat Viinel. He lived there for two years. He complained to the authorities and was told to stop making trouble. He kept complaining until they took him out of the foster home and put him in a family-type apartment in Bacu. He kept complaining until the foster couple were taken off the foster register. He had gained confidence by getting to know his older brothers, elder boys who could protect him and help him. He now saw that he had some control over his own destiny. This autumn, Viinel was in the process of organising a conference for teenagers and had invited other success stories from the system, including a fighter pilot and a civil servant, to talk about their experiences. His conference was titled My Story but Viinel was not going to tell his. I tried to tease him about this paradox. He shook his head. I like to listen to other peoples stories, not necessarily to speak myself. Viinel is an unusual success story. He went to university and remained legally under state care until last year, when he was 26 years old, the maximum age the state will support a young person if they are in higher education. But his success was his own. He was intelligent and engaging and cute. From a young age he understood that these were tools for survival, attributes that would attract adults who could help him. In his teens Viinel became active in local politics, joining the local youth wing of a liberal political party in Bacu. A local councillor called Codrin Lungu befriended him and helped to get him into a better high school so that he could take his university entrance exams. Near his school lived Constantin Prihoanc and his wife, a retired childless couple who had become foster parents to several children. Their cosy apartment became a place of respite on winter evenings. Here Viinel found a home. He took me to see them in their apartment in Bacu, a town of grey blocks and collapsing villas. Constantin was now retired but had been, in Ceauescus time, an ordinary worker, as he put it. He thought life was better under communism because back then everyone was equal, everyone had a job and an apartment. He was for the socialist party; Viinel was for the liberals and they discussed the upcoming presidential election as we sat in the little kitchen and ate the hot soup his wife had made. The mayor of Bacu was under house arrest for corruption and Viinels old friend Codrin Lungu, now a deputy in parliament, had suggested that Viinel run for mayor in his place. Will you vote for me if I am the liberal candidate? he asked Constantin and both of them laughed. When I talked to Viinels brother Virgil about his work with children, about their difficulties with personal relationships and self-esteem, I asked him what the personal consequences of his time in the system had been. He said he noticed he was reticent. And probably the fact that I have not managed to have a wife and a family is also a consequence. Neither Viinel, nor any of his brothers, have married. As I was listening to Virgil, I remembered a man I had seen in the foyer of the child protection offices in Bucharest a few days earlier. He was drunk, hobbling with a stiff, dragged-along gait. He was holding a cup of McDonalds coffee and cadging a cigarette from the security guard. His head seemed too large for his small body. The security guard knew him: he had been in the placement centre, now closed, just across the street, as a child. He was 35; although he looked 50. Another member of this ghost generation, one of the uncounted children that didnt make it. When I asked Viinel what were the things that upset him the most, he told me that it was other peoples distress. It was also clear that his pain and trauma hovered very close to the surface. More than once his expression went rigid, his throat closed and he stopped talking and left the room so as not to cry in front of me. He told me that part of the reason he had studied acting was to learn how to control emotions, how to understand yourself better and other people around you, relationships. Acting helps you to discover yourself. I realised through theatre how sensitive I am and its how I started building my mask. What is your mask? I asked him. To protect myself, to avoid getting wounded. He had played many parts, including Hamlet. Hamlet is a difficult role! I said. Yes, very, said Viinel. Especially to understand the character and his drama and his relationship to his real father and mother. His father died a few years ago but Viinel and I went to the village of Petreshte to see his mother. We stopped at the village shop and Viinel bought rice, oil, tins of meat, two loaves of bread and a kilo of biscuits to give to her. As we drove on, the road turned into a rocky track, wound up the slope of a pretty, wooded valley, thin streams of smoke rising from stove pipes, ducks in puddles. It was close to dusk. We stopped in front of the shack where Viinel had first met his father. It was impossible to imagine anyone had ever lived there, it was a ruin. A couple of years ago Viinel had convinced the mayor to build his mother a new house, next door. It was a single room made of breeze blocks, with a tin roof and no running water or electricity. Viinel walked up the sloped yard, overgrown with weeds and strewn with rubbish, and called out her name: Ileana! Ileana! He has never been able to bring himself to call her Mum. An old woman appeared, wearing a shapeless skirt and a heavy mens suit jacket. A blue headscarf was tied under her chin but wisps of wild white hair escaped it. She was barefoot. She talked in a torrent of disconnected thoughts. She was afraid to light the stove in case the house caught fire; they had taken all her animals and the donkey and she had to bar her door against the thieves. Are you Viinel? Where are you living? Is that your car? Viinel told me that once he had given her a ride in his car and she had been thrilled and said: I am pleased the state has made you a chauffeur! She wanted to take us to see one of Viinels brothers, Dumitru. She set out, still barefoot, carrying a large stick, overflowing with gossip and complaint. The state has five of my boys, the state built my house, the state did a good thing. We scrambled up a steep mud bank and came to a hut that was even smaller than his mothers house. Dumitru had built it himself from wood plastered with mud, and Viinel had sometimes stayed there during his teenage summers. There were fleas, he told me, half smiling. Inside, it smelled sour and dank, the floor was tramped earth. Two beds facing each other took up almost all of the floor space. Heaps of clothes made mattresses. Come in! Come in! Dumitru looked just like Viinel, but older and weather-worn, with jug ears and a pink flushed face. (I am surprised he was sober, Viinel said afterwards.) Dumitru fumbled for a candle and found a broken taper and stuck it into the bowl of cauliflower as a candlestick. He asked after Virgil and other brothers. And how is Viinel? I am Viinel! said Viinel. Dumitru was embarrassed. Im sorry, I get you mixed up. When we left Dumitrus hut, he hugged Viinel very tightly and said: No matter where we grew up we are all human beings.

Colomb was very much a man of that age <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><80><9c> but born into ours, he might have vented his spleen below the line on Mail Online or the Telegraph's website. Can it be, he asked, that ""Her Majesty's Government is prevented by any treaty obligations from making such regulations as shall put a stop to the free importation of destitute aliens into the United Kingdom?""</p> <p>The captain was on to something, and, as described by author Robert Winder in his <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/jun/12/history.highereducation"" title="""">admirable immigration history Bloody Foreigners</a>, it reeks of familiarity. There followed letters to the Times condemning the foreigners ""replacing English workers and driving to despair men, women and children of our blood"". Foreigners, Jewish migrants in this case, were blamed for taking jobs and driving up rents, and a society formed: the Association for Preventing the Immigration of Destitute Aliens. MigrationWatch looms like a heavy raincloud now. But it was not the first of its kind.</p> <p>And the moral is that none of what we have heard, of what we will hear this week <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><80><9c> when full rights of EU movement are granted to Romanians and Bulgarians <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><80><9c> is new. It is like The Mousetrap: the actors change, some grow old and die, but the show goes on and the script is much the same.</p> <p>These new rights of movement for Romanians and Bulgarians will dominate the immigration discourse, for at least the first quarter of 2014. Right now, these freedoms are just hours old. No one can say with confidence what is going to happen. But that won't prevent the Colombites of our time evoking the worst-case scenario, and with an election next year, expect discussion on two levels. Statisticians, academics, virtuous researchers and economists will apply what they know to produce sober analysis. And the Colombites, playing to the cheap seats, will ignore them.</p> <p>That is what they did prior to the removal of those controls on 1 January, with the right clinging doggedly to the MigrationWatch prediction that Romanian and Bulgarian immigration might add between 30,000 and 70,000 to the UK population each year for five years. Some Colombites went further. The Conservative MP <a href=""http://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/commentary/romania-and-bulgaria-accession-guessing-game"" title="""">Philip Hollobone predicted the number of Romanians and Bulgarians in the UK could triple</a> to 425,000 in two years.</p> <p>Much more sensible, but consequently of less use to those whipping up the storm, was Mark Harper. He is the immigration minister in the coalition government that has pledged to crack down on immigration, and he said claims of a mass influx were almost certainly overblown. There will be new arrivals. There will undoubtedly be new pressures. But not Armageddon. ""There is a big difference with 2004, when we were the only major country not to have transitional controls and all the other big countries did,"" <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/20/uk-immigration-romania-bulgaria-mark-harper"" title="""">said Harper last November</a>. ""Anybody who wanted to work here legally came to the UK. There are now a range of other European countries in the eurozone, including Germany, which is an economic powerhouse that is generating jobs and creating economic growth."" The minister pointed out that other countries, such as Italy and Spain, already have significant populations of Romanians and Bulgarians, and are thus more likely to attract more arrivals. His sobriety displeased the Colombites, for they countenance neither dispute or interference. MigrationWatch has warned of hordes abandoning other European countries to come to Britain. Pity Harper as he appeals for calm; derided by the Express as the ""minister without a clue"".</p> <p>He may not last, for level-headedness and immigration policy sit uneasily. His boss, the home secretary, Theresa May, has pledged to cut the numbers of migrants entering Britain and to make life more difficult for those who reach our shores. A Home Office report leaked to the Sunday Times revealed plans to restrict the number of EU migrants to 75,000 a year. It also suggested preventing them from claiming benefits or tax credits for their first five years here.</p> <p>An immigration bill due to reach the statute book in the spring will oblige private landlords to grill tenants about their immigration status. The appeals process in immigration cases will also be speeded up.

There will be other cases and she will try again, for she is nothing if not a trier. And if the analysts produce words that do not fit her tune, she will ignore them. Last month, she was accused by unnamed officials of delaying publication of a report on EU movement because <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/12/10/immigration-report-delayed-too-positive_n_4417247.html"" title="""">its conclusions were ""too positive"".</a></p> <p>There will be, as some analysts describe it, ""phantom solutions to phantom problems"". Just two weeks ago the prime minister announced tough measures to stop Romanians and Bulgarians and fellow travellers claiming out-of-work benefits for the first three months. It sends a message, he said. But it is already the case, pointed out <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/profile/jonathan-portes"" title="""">Jonathan Portes</a>, of the National institute of Economic and Social Research, and former chief economist at both the Department of Work and Pensions and the cabinet office. He said the government has figures showing how many migrants claim out-of-work benefits but seems reluctant to release them for analysis. Could that be because the figures don't support the government's brand of politicking?</p> <p>At issue are people's lives, but inevitably we discuss immigration in abstract statistics. Net migration <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><80><9c> the difference between those coming and leaving <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><80><9c> rose to 182,000 in the year to June, up from 167,000 in the previous 12 months, and therein lies the challenge for David Cameron this new year. He has pledged to reduce that figure to 100,000 in time for next year's election. In 2012/13, <a href=""http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk"" title="""">the UK Border Agency, in its last year as a standalone entity, decided 2.6m visa applications</a> and 800,000 applications from people seeking to remain in the UK. They come from all over: India, Poland, the US and Australia. We focus on migrants from eastern Europe and the former Commonwealth countries. In fact most new immigrants to the UK come from China.</p> <p>The Colombites rage, but increasingly they're estranged from the wishes of those who drive the economy, create jobs and the wealth characteristic of a capitalist market system. They are out of sync with the universities and colleges; urging them on the one hand to maximise income and then hampering their efforts to recruit sufficient foreign students to do that. The number of foreign students has apparently dropped 70,000 in two years.

Over to you, Adele</a></p>",2014,"In 1887, Captain JCR Colomb, the very Conservative MP for Bow and Bromley in east London, asked a question of fellow countrymen: ""What states of the world, other than Great Britain, permit the immigration of destitute aliens without restriction?"" Colomb was very much a man of that age  but born into ours, he might have vented his spleen below the line on Mail Online or the Telegraph's website. Can it be, he asked, that ""Her Majesty's Government is prevented by any treaty obligations from making such regulations as shall put a stop to the free importation of destitute aliens into the United Kingdom?"" The captain was on to something, and, as described by author Robert Winder in his admirable immigration history Bloody Foreigners, it reeks of familiarity. There followed letters to the Times condemning the foreigners ""replacing English workers and driving to despair men, women and children of our blood"". Foreigners, Jewish migrants in this case, were blamed for taking jobs and driving up rents, and a society formed: the Association for Preventing the Immigration of Destitute Aliens. MigrationWatch looms like a heavy raincloud now. But it was not the first of its kind. And the moral is that none of what we have heard, of what we will hear this week  when full rights of EU movement are granted to Romanians and Bulgarians  is new. It is like The Mousetrap: the actors change, some grow old and die, but the show goes on and the script is much the same. These new rights of movement for Romanians and Bulgarians will dominate the immigration discourse, for at least the first quarter of 2014. Right now, these freedoms are just hours old. No one can say with confidence what is going to happen. But that won't prevent the Colombites of our time evoking the worst-case scenario, and with an election next year, expect discussion on two levels. Statisticians, academics, virtuous researchers and economists will apply what they know to produce sober analysis. And the Colombites, playing to the cheap seats, will ignore them. That is what they did prior to the removal of those controls on 1 January, with the right clinging doggedly to the MigrationWatch prediction that Romanian and Bulgarian immigration might add between 30,000 and 70,000 to the UK population each year for five years. Some Colombites went further. The Conservative MP Philip Hollobone predicted the number of Romanians and Bulgarians in the UK could triple to 425,000 in two years. Much more sensible, but consequently of less use to those whipping up the storm, was Mark Harper. He is the immigration minister in the coalition government that has pledged to crack down on immigration, and he said claims of a mass influx were almost certainly overblown. There will be new arrivals. There will undoubtedly be new pressures. But not Armageddon. ""There is a big difference with 2004, when we were the only major country not to have transitional controls and all the other big countries did,"" said Harper last November. ""Anybody who wanted to work here legally came to the UK. There are now a range of other European countries in the eurozone, including Germany, which is an economic powerhouse that is generating jobs and creating economic growth."" The minister pointed out that other countries, such as Italy and Spain, already have significant populations of Romanians and Bulgarians, and are thus more likely to attract more arrivals. His sobriety displeased the Colombites, for they countenance neither dispute or interference. MigrationWatch has warned of hordes abandoning other European countries to come to Britain. Pity Harper as he appeals for calm; derided by the Express as the ""minister without a clue"". He may not last, for level-headedness and immigration policy sit uneasily. His boss, the home secretary, Theresa May, has pledged to cut the numbers of migrants entering Britain and to make life more difficult for those who reach our shores. A Home Office report leaked to the Sunday Times revealed plans to restrict the number of EU migrants to 75,000 a year. It also suggested preventing them from claiming benefits or tax credits for their first five years here. An immigration bill due to reach the statute book in the spring will oblige private landlords to grill tenants about their immigration status. The appeals process in immigration cases will also be speeded up. As for any migrants judged to have broken the law, the rule will be deport first, hear the appeal later. May failed last year to deport the boat race protester Trenton Oldfield, subsequent to his having served two months of a six-month sentence, but the message is out. There will be other cases and she will try again, for she is nothing if not a trier. And if the analysts produce words that do not fit her tune, she will ignore them. Last month, she was accused by unnamed officials of delaying publication of a report on EU movement because its conclusions were ""too positive"". There will be, as some analysts describe it, ""phantom solutions to phantom problems"". Just two weeks ago the prime minister announced tough measures to stop Romanians and Bulgarians and fellow travellers claiming out-of-work benefits for the first three months. It sends a message, he said. But it is already the case, pointed out Jonathan Portes, of the National institute of Economic and Social Research, and former chief economist at both the Department of Work and Pensions and the cabinet office. He said the government has figures showing how many migrants claim out-of-work benefits but seems reluctant to release them for analysis. Could that be because the figures don't support the government's brand of politicking? At issue are people's lives, but inevitably we discuss immigration in abstract statistics. Net migration  the difference between those coming and leaving  rose to 182,000 in the year to June, up from 167,000 in the previous 12 months, and therein lies the challenge for David Cameron this new year. He has pledged to reduce that figure to 100,000 in time for next year's election. In 2012/13, the UK Border Agency, in its last year as a standalone entity, decided 2.6m visa applications and 800,000 applications from people seeking to remain in the UK. They come from all over: India, Poland, the US and Australia. We focus on migrants from eastern Europe and the former Commonwealth countries. In fact most new immigrants to the UK come from China. The Colombites rage, but increasingly they're estranged from the wishes of those who drive the economy, create jobs and the wealth characteristic of a capitalist market system. They are out of sync with the universities and colleges; urging them on the one hand to maximise income and then hampering their efforts to recruit sufficient foreign students to do that. The number of foreign students has apparently dropped 70,000 in two years. They are out of step with countries with whom they might trade; one minute declaring Britain open for business, the next projecting their anxieties on foreign businessfolk seeking entry through our ports and airports. It's a given that our approach to immigration will continue to be blighted by inconsistencies. It has been for centuries. Some migrants we like: think of the young Spaniards, Italians and Greeks who have come  without public uproar  to escape austerity in their own countries. Some we do not, usually because  numbers aside  their social and cultural differences require accommodation. And some we will like in time as they become part of the fabric. As part of that cycle, many of them will be just as critical of the next wave of migrants. The real crisis would be a Britain that migrants do not aspire to, but our drivers of immigration policy will not change: part pragmatism, part altruism, part prejudice and heavily shaped by the populist demands of boisterous democratic politics. As it was in Colomb's day, so it will be in 2014.

Then, on that day, hundreds of ordinary Romanians armed only with stones and courage surged past troops and stormed inside.</p> <p>There could be no clearer sign that the regime<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s grip on its cold, hungry, deprived people had been broken. Dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife Elena raced for a helicopter waiting on the roof, as bewildered as they were scared. His 25-year control of the country had been complete and paranoid. Children who presented flowers at official events had to spend days in quarantine first, portraits that only showed one of his ears were banned, and dissidents were jailed or worse.</p> <p>As communist governments collapsed across Europe, Ceausescu looked set to ride out the wave of longing and discontent, fuelled by clandestine reports on change elsewhere, until a standoff with a dissident priest in western Romania triggered his downfall.</p> <p>On 17 December troops fired on crowds that had gathered to stop pastor Laszlo Tokes being evicted from his home. Dozens were killed and news of the brutality whipped through Romania, sparking protests in other cities. Within a week Ceausescu had vanished from Bucharest and from power, his departure stunning a country that for so long had bent to his will.

The image of Romania<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s communist despot reduced to a crumpled, bloody corpse was beamed across the world, apparently a triumphant declaration of all-out revolution. A new era had begun.</p> <p>Fast forward 25 years and the verdict on what happened next is, at best, mixed. Many argue that the execution of the Ceausescus was a false dawn.

Supporters believe he can finally deliver the profound changes promised a quarter of a century ago. Klaus Iohannis is a political outsider who stunned the country by winning an election many voters assumed was all but delivered to his rival, prime minister Victor Ponta.</p> <p>A former teacher and provincial mayor from an ethnic minority group, his second-round victory was due in part to Romanians abroad, who queued for hours at embassies but were still blocked from voting by arcane and apparently obstructive rules.

Then, on that day, hundreds of ordinary Romanians armed only with stones and courage surged past troops and stormed inside. There could be no clearer sign that the regimes grip on its cold, hungry, deprived people had been broken. Dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife Elena raced for a helicopter waiting on the roof, as bewildered as they were scared. His 25-year control of the country had been complete and paranoid. Children who presented flowers at official events had to spend days in quarantine first, portraits that only showed one of his ears were banned, and dissidents were jailed or worse. As communist governments collapsed across Europe, Ceausescu looked set to ride out the wave of longing and discontent, fuelled by clandestine reports on change elsewhere, until a standoff with a dissident priest in western Romania triggered his downfall. On 17 December troops fired on crowds that had gathered to stop pastor Laszlo Tokes being evicted from his home. Dozens were killed and news of the brutality whipped through Romania, sparking protests in other cities. Within a week Ceausescu had vanished from Bucharest and from power, his departure stunning a country that for so long had bent to his will. His reappearance in TV news reports three days later, as an executed convict, was almost as shocking. I thought, Dear God, to kill someone on Christmas day! It doesnt matter how bad they are, this should be a celebration of life, said dissident poet Ana Blandiana, who spent years under surveillance. The image of Romanias communist despot reduced to a crumpled, bloody corpse was beamed across the world, apparently a triumphant declaration of all-out revolution. A new era had begun. Fast forward 25 years and the verdict on what happened next is, at best, mixed. Many argue that the execution of the Ceausescus was a false dawn. The show trial was organised by fellow communists, who twisted a popular uprising into little more than a palace coup and held on firmly to the levers of power. I am certain now that revolutions are conceived by idealists, enacted by fighters and taken advantage of by opportunists, said Dumitru Mazilu, a dissident communist official jailed by Ceausescu for smuggling a human rights report to the UN. Prominent at the start of the revolution, he called for senior communists to be blocked from office in Romania, but was sidelined after asking the man who went on to become president: Who are you and what have you been doing the last five years? That man, Ion Iliescu, and other former communists ran the government for years and still sit in parliament. Former members of the security forces and their families have got rich from privatisation and there has been no justice for the regimes former victims. Romania was one of Europes few former Soviet bloc countries that did not pass a lustration law to ban senior communists from holding office in the new government. In the beginning it was real, the blockades, the people crushed by tanks, said Romulus Rusan, director of the Memorial for the Victims of Communism and the Resistance and husband of Blandiana. But there were two types of people in the revolution, those shouting Down with communism, and those only shouting Down with Ceausescu. It was the second group who created the new political order after 1989. Even today no Romanian other than the Ceausescus has been found guilty of even the smallest role in the communist partys half-century reign of terror and misery. We have lived all these years with the illusion of liberty, said Christina Dan, 30, a civil servant. They were not our leaders, they were communists who the day after the revolution were not communists. Dan braved sleet to join a national day parade this month, carrying a sign saying Romanians are beautiful for other visitors to hold and photograph. We started this project to show we have beautiful people about, to trust each other. Because from the last revolution, there was a bad experience, Dan said. She is one of dozens of young Romanians roused to anger and political action over the last two years in what veterans like Rusan hope will be a revolution reborn. On 22 December, 25 years after the revolution, Romania will swear in a new president. Supporters believe he can finally deliver the profound changes promised a quarter of a century ago. Klaus Iohannis is a political outsider who stunned the country by winning an election many voters assumed was all but delivered to his rival, prime minister Victor Ponta. A former teacher and provincial mayor from an ethnic minority group, his second-round victory was due in part to Romanians abroad, who queued for hours at embassies but were still blocked from voting by arcane and apparently obstructive rules. Some of the enraged diaspora flew home to vote but, more importantly, their plight fired up thousands at home to take to the streets. Down with Ponta! Down with communism! read banners at protests, even though Ponta, at 42, is too young to have held office in the communist government. But protesters see him as part of a regime that protected and promoted the old ruling class. With those who got rich, you see a network of connections into the communist elite and the security service, said Laura Stefan, an expert on justice and corruption at a Bucharest thinktank, The Expert Forum. In Romania there was no attempt to hold anyone to account for many years. We have a saying: The head that looks down wont be cut off. The Ceausescus killing showcased a disregard for the rule of law that continued for many years. When change came, in part under pressure from the European Union, it was focused on tackling corruption in the post-communist era. If there are so many victims yet to find justice, there is no rule of law, says General Dan Voinea, prosecutor at the Ceausescus trial, who later forged an unexpected career seeking justice for more than 1,000 people killed in the revolution. He is unrepentant about his role in what he insists was rough but real justice for a dictator with blood on his hands, and managed to secure the convictions of a handful of leaders for ordering troops to fire on protesters and other crimes during the revolution. As time passes, victims and perpetrators of crimes dating to the 1950s are dying. The hopes of those who wanted to see someone pay for the death of a parent, the torture of a spouse or other mistreatment were raised when the European court in Strasbourg ruled that there was no statute of limitations on crimes against humanity. But the Institute for the Investigation of Communist Crimes and Memory of the Romanian Exile, which is meant to be spearheading efforts to hold historical abusers to account, has not got far. A list of nearly 170 potential targets for prosecution, published in 2007, has so far produced no convictions. A single trial finally began this autumn, but is proceeding at a glacial pace. Nobody was ever convicted, says the institute head, Cosmin Budeanca. A few cases are open in front of prosecutors, but we need political will for something to happen. A political appointee himself, critics say Budeanca is happy to drag his feet. He insists he is boxed in by lack of resources and intransigence from government officials unenthusiastic about revisiting the past. Politicians resums start from the 1990s, because what came before was not comfortable to present to the population, he says. There are no prosecutors who specialise in crimes against humanity, he says, and there is a staff of only 36 to fight the bureaucracy. The justice ministry archives are out of bounds and interior ministry and former security service archives restricted. Its never too late for the truth to come out, analyst Stefan insists. Failure to deal with the recent past has a lot of relevance for how we are as a society today. One aspect is a growing nostalgia for Ceausescus rule, including among Romanians who were spared rationing, propaganda and political controls. More than a third of teenagers born and raised after 1989 think life was better under communism than it is today, a 2011 survey by the Soros foundation found. A quarter of them never had a single class on the era at school. Romanian society and, most of all, the young generation is forgetting about the evils of communism, research co-ordinator Ovidiu Voicu told a Romanian newspaper when the research was published. It is from this point that we begin the debate on including the history of communism in the education system, and try to find an answer to the question of how to avoid repeating past mistakes. The deprivations included government-controlled neighbourhood central heating systems that kept whole blocks of flats at less than 10 degrees during frigid winters, and queues for food at department stores that started around 2am, even though people had no idea what they were waiting to buy. I always feel I have to have a fridge full of food, my wife and I argue about it. I think its because ours was always empty when I was a child, said Budeanca. For years, Stefan gagged at the thought of shrimps, because of the crackers they were fed as children, made in North Korea from the ground-up shells of crustaceans. Communisms great victory was the creation of a people without a memory, warns a plaque at the memorial institute set up by Blandiana and Rusan. That grim achievement still apparently haunts the country, long after communism was banished. But the protesters who helped to propel Iohannis to power on the back of his promises of change say they willnot allow another revolution to bestolen. They roused five million people to vote, said George Epurescu, a physics lecturer and president of protest group Romania Without Them. That is a dangerous weapon, because they got their votes but have also awakened these people."

On Christmas Day, 1989 he guarded the couples melodramatic show trial, led them out as Ceausescu sang the Internationale and his less-composed wife screamed fuck you at a mocking sergeant, lined them up against a wall then strafed them with bullets from his Kalashnikov. It happened so quickly that a military journalist videoing the trial captured only the last round of bullets and the crumpled bodies on the floor. But those few seconds have shadowed the ageing paratroopers whole life. I still get nervous talking about this, he says, cradling a glass of brandy. Its two lives that I ended. It is a big deal. In a war its OK, but when you kill unarmed people its more difficult. I wouldnt wish this on anyone, even though my job is killing people. Bulky, mustachioed, and anxiously alert in grainy video of the trial, he has expanded into a rotund grandfather who has no regrets about putting a definitive end to Ceausescus regime of fear, poverty and deprivation. His family were among millions persecuted. My grandfather was a priest, a liberal, he was in prison for a lot of his life, Boyeru said. He was really happy after those events, happy that the regime had changed, that Ceausescu died, and he told me, Dont worry, I take all your sins upon myself. Being one of the last centurys most famous executioners came at a heavy price. It cost him his privacy, his peace and his marriage to a woman worried about his gruesome fame. Boyeru believes his bullets killed both Ceausescus because, when he started shooting, one member of the three-person firing squad froze for several seconds and the second had forgotten to put his weapon on an automatic setting so squeezed out only a few individual shots. The couple, still very much in love, had asked to die together in defiance of a sentence that ordered separate executions. He granted their last wish, and takes some consolation from killing them before they could break down. I shot them very fast. I feel I helped them to die with dignity. He half expected to feel the thud of bullets into his own back seconds later, from a heavy machine gun stationed behind them, clearing up the men responsible for the audacious execution. Romanians of his generation, educated in communist theory at school and human cruelty in their daily lives, can still be matter-of-fact about the price of political turmoil. Any revolution demands blood. And also the revolution eats its heroes. You cannot forget this, he says with a shrug. Boyeru was 31, an officer in an elite unit of paratroopers, when he volunteered for a mystery Christmas mission. They only got their orders minutes before meeting a cologne-soaked Nicolae Ceausescu, who had been absolute ruler just days earlier. The minister asked me, Captain, can you do this? I said, Yes. What could I say? Romania was spiralling into chaos, one of the last Soviet satellite states in eastern Europe to throw off its communist leadership. Boyerus unit had secretly followed an unfolding revolution on Radio Free Europe, which was nicknamed the little lizard, perhaps because it was banned but still slipped through cracks in the propaganda edifice. On 21 December, the whole unit had been forced to swear loyalty to the man Boyeru would kill within a week. They made us sign a statement saying we didnt agree with what was happening, and vowing we would support and protect Ceausescu. The next day they watched in shock as the grey Central Committee building, seat of communist power, was taken over by protesters and Ceausescu and his wife fled by helicopter. Soldiers were crying with happiness, people you previously might have thought agreed with the regime entirely were bursting out with excitement. We took out our hidden alcohol, a very bad brandy, and drank. Then for several days they waited in barracks, bored but tense. Imagine if I could shoot Ceausescu. If only I could get my hands on him, what would I do? one friend told Boyeru on Christmas Eve. He was Dorin Cirlan and the very next day he would unwittingly volunteer to join the firing squad. It was an ill-fated wish, because on the flight back from the trial site, the helicopter was crammed with prosecutors, judges and top military brass. There was no room in the helicopter so Cirlan had to sit on the bodies, and he is the most traumatised. Boyeru said. Everyone wanted to be in our place then. Now, no one does."

Recently declassified files at the National College for Studying the Securitate Archives (CNSAS) in Bucharest suggest that the furniture firm agreed to be overcharged for products made in Romania. Some of the overpayments were deposited in an account controlled by the Securitate, the secret police agency. The documents suggest Ikea was complicit in the arrangement. Ikea denies complicity, but has launched an internal investigation into the matter. It says it was unaware of the Securitate's involvement in its commercial operations. The revelations will nonetheless raise new questions about Ikea's operations during the cold war, when it also used East German political prisoners to build its products. Ikea was one of a small number of western companies that took advantage of the increasing openness for business of several eastern bloc countries during the 1980s. It was particularly attracted to the prodigious timber resources and cheap labour offered by a country such as Romania. It made a deal with a Romanian state-run timber company, Tehnoforestexport, in 1981 which by the middle of that decade was worth about 10m a year. According to the documents, the Securitate used a special foreign trade company called ICE Dunarea to skim money from the deals. The Securitate, which did the dirty work of Romania's dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, torturing and killing thousands of political opponents during his 24 years in power, is believed to have made billions of dollars out of state-sanctioned rackets, kickbacks and other commercial-criminal ruses. The opening of this part of the Securitate archive this year has shed a mottled light for the first time on some of these economic operations. In the Ikea files  given the codename ""Scandinavica""  a cache of formerly top-secret notes, memos, bank statements and reports from the Securitate, coupled with copies of agreements between Tehnoforestexport and Ikea detail how the Securitate got involved in the deal. One note, from May 1986, written by a senior, unnamed Securitate official, says in March 1983, ""there were undertaken by cooperation specific intelligence-operational measures to execute some special currency operations. These consisted of the collection of a 1.85% commission, from the sum resulting from the overbilling agreed with the foreign partner."" A second note from the ""Ministry of Interior, Department of State Security, Military Unit 0544"", dated 27 September 1986 and marked ""Top Secret, sole copy"", explains in official language that the ""Scandinavica currency collection operation"" was initiated ""with the aim of receiving foreign currency through over-billing the payments made in the contract between ICE Tehnoforestexport with Ikea of Sweden, valued at 97m Swedish crowns (13.6m US dollars)."" The Securitate note added: ""Ikea transferred in our transitory account the sum of 163,005.201 Swedish crowns."" The note was signed by ""Major Eftimie Gelu"", a man revealed in previously declassified CNSAS documents to be Constantin Anghelache, who is now the executive chairman of Dinamo Bucharest football club, which was formerly the interior ministry's football team. When the Guardian asked Anghelache about his Securitate past and the Ikea affair, he refused to comment. Earlier he had told other reporters: ""You are getting into technical issues of exterior commerce"", adding ""Do I do this any more? I'm with the football,"" in what appeared to be an implicit admission of his Securitate past. The documents suggest some of the overpayments made by Ikea were to have been paid back later to a bank account in East Berlin, minus interest accrued. ""It was established that the sums originating from overbilling be kept at the Romania Bank of Foreign Commerce and their restitution be made twice a year at the addresses indicated by Ikea, after retaining the due share of the account beneficiary,"" reads the typewritten May 1986 document, now archived on microfilm. The 1986 files reveal that it took the Securitate about six months to repay the monies, during which it made $41,283.28 from interest. At one point, according to the May 1986 file, an Ikea executive named as Ingvar Nilson travelled to Romania to try to recoup the money. The files contain no details about any similar operations conducted during the other years of Ikea's involvement in Romania. Operation Scandinavica was closed in 1988, when Ikea discontinued its dealings with Tehnoforestexport. Over seven years, its Romanian partner produced a wide selection of products for Ikea, including parts of the Billy range, Albert chairs, Abo tables and Jonas desks. These were shipped to Ikea stores in Sweden, Germany, Denmark, Austria, France, Belgium and Holland, though not Britain. Ikea denies it knowingly paid money to the Securitate. In a statement, it said it was looking at the Securitate files as part of an investigation into the revelations. Henrik Elm, their global purchasing manager, told the Guardian: ""It was normal at the time and in that part of the world to work with commissions. We only had one business partner, Tehnoforestexport. We worked on a product price plus two commissions structure. One commission was for Tehnoforestexport, to cover operations and technology, and one was for Ikea, for trading purposes and to transfer knowledge and technology such as machinery to the manufacturer."" Ikea's deals with Tehnoforestexport make no mention of third parties or payments to ICE Dunarea, speaking only vaguely of ""spare parts"" and ""service activity"". ""The prices in the enclosure No 1 to the Addendum No 31 include 0.2% spare parts and/or service activity which will be granted by the sellers on the buyers' specific request,"" says a written protocol dated 7 February 1986. Roxana Bratu, an expert in corruption in totalitarian regimes such as Ceausescu's and a researcher at the School of Slavonic & East European Studies of University College London, said: ""It seems that there are indeed serious clues of unorthodox arrangements that are described by the Romanian authorities as 'overbilling' and disguised by the Swedish representatives as 'commissions' or 'equipment pay.'"" Between its formation in 1947 and its dismantling in 1991, the Securitate produced an unquantifiable number of victims  as well as the political prisoners and disappearances, the torture sessions, forced labour and direct intimidation of potential dissidents are conservatively estimated to have targeted hundreds of thousands of people. It is not known either exactly how many people were murdered by the Securitate, but unmarked shallow graves and lime pits full of the corpses of people who vanished in the communist years are still being discovered. The agency's funding was very generous, virtually limitless, during the early years of its existence. But in the 1980s it was given a slightly different task  to get its hands on foreign currency to reduce the foreign debt accumulated by the regime. This enabled officers to start profitable operations, ostensibly for the state, but latterly to enrich themselves and fund ad hoc operations such as smuggling and people trafficking. Press reports give the estimate of the total accounts held at the time of the 1989 revolution at $4bn in cash in the Romanian Bank of Foreign Trade, not including assets and investments. Most of the money held in those communist coffers was never accounted for, but many prominent figures from the Securitate rose to dominate Romania's business environment, the military, the police and areas of public policy in the subsequent democracy. Curiously, although verbally condemned by politicians, no laws were passed to hold the Securitate to account. No members of the Securitate were prosecuted for their crimes, with the recent exception of three ageing former prison chiefs, now destitute pensioners. They were charged with crimes against humanity and will have to pay 25% of their (very low) income to the descendants of their victims if they are convicted.  This article was amended on 9 October 2014 to correct a reference to three former Securitae having been convicted of crimes against humanity. They have been charged, but proceedings are still ongoing."

He confessed to be ""a Roma Gypsy from Romania"" and before coming to the UK three years ago he had first tried his luck in eight other countries: ""I made my way by pick-pocketing, thieving and other small crimes. I was put in prison or arrested by the police in Norway, Finland, Sweden, Spain, Italy, France, Austria and Germany before I arrived here.""</p> <p>For the interviewer, however, Rudi was probably a highly credible person, as he convinced the journalist that he was better informed than the UK Border Agency about the number of passengers coming every day from Romania to the UK by plane, bus or car.</p> <p>According to the newspaper, he said: ""Your benefits system is crazy. It's like finding a sack full of cash that has been dropped, picking it up and no one saying anything,"" claiming that he left Romania ""because the authorities refuse to give us jobs"". But once in Britain, he showed little interest to work, thinking instead about benefits. ""He sells scrap metal or does some decorating, which has allowed him to claim social welfare.""</p> <p>The fact that he has been resident in the UK for three years confirms what I have stated on several occasions, namely that people who intended to emigrate are already here, and that restrictions on the labour market have not been an obstacle for exercising the right to free movement in the EU.</p> <p>As for being a ""Roma Gypsy"" and therefore not being able to support himself at home, in Romania every person has equal access to employment. Indeed, people should work before claiming benefits. In order to receive benefits, you should first contribute. This is only fair. We too are against the culture of ""getting something for nothing"". But from his comments, it is reasonable to conclude that Rudi's intention in no less than 10 European countries was not to work.</p> <p>Romania is against any form of discrimination and many projects for Roma social inclusion have been developed in the fields of education, employment, housing and health. There are 600,000 Roma people living in Romania and more than 12 million on the continent. <a href=""https://fullfact.org/factchecks/how_many_roma_live_in_the_uk-29258"" title="""">According</a> to the University of Salford, in the UK alone there are about 200,000 Roma, with the biggest number coming from Slovakia, Czech Republic and Hungary. The government of Romania has repeatedly argued the need for a common European strategy in order to help integrate and improve the life conditions of Roma people in Europe. We have to fight stereotypes and prejudice against Roma, but also mentalities inside this community.</p> <p>Romania supports and applies measures to fight abuses of any kind, and the Romanian authorities condemn any attempts to defraud the existing national systems. Abuses do not have names or nationality. They are breaches of the law which are fought against with important tools of co-operation. For instance, we routinely share information with British authorities about cases of benefit fraud and abuses, based on data received from the Romanian law enforcement.</p> <p>The person interviewed by the Daily Mail is certainly not representative of Romanians living in the UK who, in their overwhelming majority, contribute substantially to the public purse and are highly valued by the local communities they live in. Nor is ""the ebullient Rudi"" a representative for Roma, most of whom work hard to earn their living and are not involved in criminal activities.</p> <p>In the case of Romanians, ""benefit tourism as such is a myth"" indeed, because from 5.7 million working age benefit claimants in the UK last year, only 1,740 were Romanians, which represents 0.03% of the total claimants, or 1.45% of the Romanian community in Britain. To compare, the percentage of working age benefit claimants for the whole UK population is 9.5%. Hopefully, the measures recently adopted by the British government to fight abuses to the benefits system will encourage many people who live on benefits in this country to find jobs.</p> <p>Last year, the Romanian government succeeded to create almost 100,000 new jobs and in January 2014 more than 10,000 jobs were available. But our employers are now in competition with British employers, who only last month advertised 10,367 vacancies for Romanians.</p> <p>The Romanian economy is growing fast, with a 5.2% GDP growth in the final quarter of 2013 <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><80><9c> the biggest rise in the EU <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><80><9c> and a full-year rate of 3.5%, (the EU average growth was only 0.1%). The inflation rate at the end of 2013 was about 1% and unemployment 7% (well below the EU average of 10.7%). The industrial production in Romania increased by 7% in 2013; the second largest rise in the EU.</p> <p>Wages are on the rise <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><80><9c> not the same level as in the UK, but prices are lower in Romania, houses are more affordable, the food is organic and the sun shines for longer than in other parts of Europe.</p> <p>Last week, the Financial Times <a href=""http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2014/02/14/a-new-tiger-romania-hits-5-2-per-cent-growth-in-last-quarter/"" title="""">called my country</a> ""an eastern European tiger"", while noting that ""Romania's performance gives grounds for optimism.

It also shows a degree of confidence in Romania's fiscal consolidation.""</p> <p>Romania is the seventh largest market within the EU and the largest in south-eastern Europe.

With the favourable economic climate and the focus on development and investments, we expect more and more Romanians to come back.</p>",2014,"After the disappointment of not seeing waves of Romanians arriving in the UK once restrictions were lifted, some tabloids have found a new eastern European bestseller: the abuse to the benefits system. A particular case attracted my attention: the Daily Mail interviewed ""Rudi"", described as ""an ebullient 28 years old"" who lives with his family on benefits, around Nottingham. He confessed to be ""a Roma Gypsy from Romania"" and before coming to the UK three years ago he had first tried his luck in eight other countries: ""I made my way by pick-pocketing, thieving and other small crimes. I was put in prison or arrested by the police in Norway, Finland, Sweden, Spain, Italy, France, Austria and Germany before I arrived here."" For the interviewer, however, Rudi was probably a highly credible person, as he convinced the journalist that he was better informed than the UK Border Agency about the number of passengers coming every day from Romania to the UK by plane, bus or car. According to the newspaper, he said: ""Your benefits system is crazy. It's like finding a sack full of cash that has been dropped, picking it up and no one saying anything,"" claiming that he left Romania ""because the authorities refuse to give us jobs"". But once in Britain, he showed little interest to work, thinking instead about benefits. ""He sells scrap metal or does some decorating, which has allowed him to claim social welfare."" The fact that he has been resident in the UK for three years confirms what I have stated on several occasions, namely that people who intended to emigrate are already here, and that restrictions on the labour market have not been an obstacle for exercising the right to free movement in the EU. As for being a ""Roma Gypsy"" and therefore not being able to support himself at home, in Romania every person has equal access to employment. Indeed, people should work before claiming benefits. In order to receive benefits, you should first contribute. This is only fair. We too are against the culture of ""getting something for nothing"". But from his comments, it is reasonable to conclude that Rudi's intention in no less than 10 European countries was not to work. Romania is against any form of discrimination and many projects for Roma social inclusion have been developed in the fields of education, employment, housing and health. There are 600,000 Roma people living in Romania and more than 12 million on the continent. According to the University of Salford, in the UK alone there are about 200,000 Roma, with the biggest number coming from Slovakia, Czech Republic and Hungary. The government of Romania has repeatedly argued the need for a common European strategy in order to help integrate and improve the life conditions of Roma people in Europe. We have to fight stereotypes and prejudice against Roma, but also mentalities inside this community. Romania supports and applies measures to fight abuses of any kind, and the Romanian authorities condemn any attempts to defraud the existing national systems. Abuses do not have names or nationality. They are breaches of the law which are fought against with important tools of co-operation. For instance, we routinely share information with British authorities about cases of benefit fraud and abuses, based on data received from the Romanian law enforcement. The person interviewed by the Daily Mail is certainly not representative of Romanians living in the UK who, in their overwhelming majority, contribute substantially to the public purse and are highly valued by the local communities they live in. Nor is ""the ebullient Rudi"" a representative for Roma, most of whom work hard to earn their living and are not involved in criminal activities. In the case of Romanians, ""benefit tourism as such is a myth"" indeed, because from 5.7 million working age benefit claimants in the UK last year, only 1,740 were Romanians, which represents 0.03% of the total claimants, or 1.45% of the Romanian community in Britain. To compare, the percentage of working age benefit claimants for the whole UK population is 9.5%. Hopefully, the measures recently adopted by the British government to fight abuses to the benefits system will encourage many people who live on benefits in this country to find jobs. Last year, the Romanian government succeeded to create almost 100,000 new jobs and in January 2014 more than 10,000 jobs were available. But our employers are now in competition with British employers, who only last month advertised 10,367 vacancies for Romanians. The Romanian economy is growing fast, with a 5.2% GDP growth in the final quarter of 2013  the biggest rise in the EU  and a full-year rate of 3.5%, (the EU average growth was only 0.1%). The inflation rate at the end of 2013 was about 1% and unemployment 7% (well below the EU average of 10.7%). The industrial production in Romania increased by 7% in 2013; the second largest rise in the EU. Wages are on the rise  not the same level as in the UK, but prices are lower in Romania, houses are more affordable, the food is organic and the sun shines for longer than in other parts of Europe. Last week, the Financial Times called my country ""an eastern European tiger"", while noting that ""Romania's performance gives grounds for optimism. Investors' appetite for a $2bn Romanian bond issue in January  five times oversubscribed  reflects broader enthusiasm. It also shows a degree of confidence in Romania's fiscal consolidation."" Romania is the seventh largest market within the EU and the largest in south-eastern Europe. There is a huge potential for investment projects and bilateral economic co-operation. More than 4,000 British companies are registered in Romania with a total investment of about 4.6bn. But growth cannot be sustained without our most valuable asset, the labour force, and therefore we certainly do not want our people leaving. With the favourable economic climate and the focus on development and investments, we expect more and more Romanians to come back."

However I always go back to Bulgaria in the end and prefer to stay here when not on on-site work elsewhere for three main reasons: very low taxes for high earners, the low cost of living, and an already established social circle of contacts In my experience this is hardly uncommon. The Bulgarian ecomomy is undercapitalized so there is an excess of skilled labor. Many professionals go to Britain and the western EU not to stay but to build financial security and professional confidence. Some of my friends return like me, some stay for now but very few view themselves as ""there to stay"". I know there is also some low-income migration but in the long term they can hardly compete with Asian/African/Middle East migrants. They either move up to skilled labor or eventually go back. A probable exception to this is the Roma minority  they are socially isolated anywhere they go so Bulgaria is as foreign to them as Britain. Overall Bulgarians are very loud to complain about being the poorest country in the EU and having the worst politicians. But if you look at the big picture it's a country of medium wealth and good long-term economic prospects where politicians are just as incompetent and irrelevant as pretty much anywhere else. skydiver134 I moved to the UK in 2010 because it was hard for me to find a job to pay for my studies in Romania. Now I am a degree in Economics Science and I tried to apply for a good job (as receptionist and secretary) but always I received the same answer: Sorry but you are Romanian and we can't employ you. I miss Romania every second of my life because here is my family and part of my life but the UK is giving me the chance for a better future. I am working hard and pay 20% tax for someone else's benefits, and i receive lots of bad insults and all these messages from news about Romania. It's very hard to be a foreigner in UK, but I will try my best to show everyone that a Romanian can be human and not the worst person in the world! ancabostiog23 Are you a Romanian or Bulgarian with experience of seeking work in the UK?

Those claims were later more or less proved to be wrong and it seems, at least on a short term basis, that there was nothing really in those scare stories.  In the first three months of this year (and the first three months that Bulgarians and Romanians could work in the country without restrictions) the number here (122,000) actually fell by 3,000 on the figures for the end of 2013, according to new figures from the Office for National Statistics.  The ONS break down the figures by nationality and country of birth and it is arguable the latter is more accurate - even though the bigger figure is more appealing for those reporting on the story. For those who were born in those countries, the number was down by 4,000 to 140,000. The numbers are not seasonally adjusted but it is clearly evident that the rapid influx of workers has not happened yet, if it is going to. While the number is down on the end of 2013, there are 19,000 more Bulgarians and Romanians (using nationality) working here now than this time last year - a 18.5% rise. However, as Alan Travis points out there will be 60,000 fewer short-term workers from Romania and Bulgaria coming to Britain this year after the closure of a seasonal agricultural workers scheme. Undermining the controversial Ukip poster campaign claiming 26m people in the EU are after your jobs, the figures for the last 12 months showed that the vast majority of new jobs in the last year went to UK nationals. British workers took 563,000 of new jobs compared to foreign nationals who took 178,000.  The historical comparison that is often drawn on is the unexpectedly high numbers of migrants that entered the country when restrictions were lifted for eight new EU member states in May 2004. It's hard to call right now whether the same thing will happen with Romanian and Bulgarian migrants.  Although there was a spike immediately after the border restrictions were lifted, that plateaued a little bit before rising higher and higher in the months and years following.  What is evident here is that the ""immigrants are all going to pile in at once"" idea is a pretty simplistic view of migration patterns and that has been reinforced by today's statistical release.

No mass stampede, this.</p> <p>So when the arrivals door swung open and Spirescu sauntered out, woolly cap pulled down over his ears, swinging his holdall, and confirmed he was indeed coming to the UK for the first time, he found himself deluged by microphone-wielding media.</p> <p>Did he speak English, journalists asked. Yes, he had learned it from watching MTV and films and using the internet, he&#xa0;replied.</p> <p>Did he have a job? ""Yes. I go to work. Tomorrow I work."" He had a job lined up washing cars and hoped to get a better one. He was ""very excited"" at the prospect he said.</p> <p>It did not take long for someone to mention ""the B word"", and to ask his opinion of those who wanted to come to the UK to claim benefits.

""What is that?"" he replied. Home for Spirescu is the small village of Pelisor, in Transylvania. That is where his wife, Catalina, lives and where she waved him off, wishing him good luck and saying she hoped to see him return ""very soon with a lot of money"".</p> <p>And that is where he intends to return. He is here to earn money to ""renovate my home and make a good life in Romania because it's much easier to live in Romania, because it's not expensive"".</p> <p>Spirescu found himself a job washing cars through a friend. His boss was sorting out his accommodation.

But as one of a tiny handful of Romanians on board Wizz Air flight W63701 from Trgu Mures to take advantage of the lifting of border restrictions on 1 January, Spirescu, 30, a construction worker travelling with his friend Julian Barbat, a wild boar hunter, found himself in high demand. Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, and Conservative committee member Mark Reckless were at Luton, they said, ""to see for ourselves"" the procedures in place on the first day of unrestricted access to the UK for Romanian and Bulgarian workers. What they found was a plane three-quarters full, with the overwhelming majority of the 146 passengers returning to jobs in the UK having enjoyed Christmas break with their families at home. No mass stampede, this. So when the arrivals door swung open and Spirescu sauntered out, woolly cap pulled down over his ears, swinging his holdall, and confirmed he was indeed coming to the UK for the first time, he found himself deluged by microphone-wielding media. Did he speak English, journalists asked. Yes, he had learned it from watching MTV and films and using the internet, hereplied. Did he have a job? ""Yes. I go to work. Tomorrow I work."" He had a job lined up washing cars and hoped to get a better one. He was ""very excited"" at the prospect he said. It did not take long for someone to mention ""the B word"", and to ask his opinion of those who wanted to come to the UK to claim benefits. Spirescu shrugged goodnaturedly. ""I don't know. I come here to work because I love to work."" He was earning 10 (8.30) a day in construction back home. Perhaps, he said, ""I can get 10 an hour, maybe?"" He seemed genuinely perplexed when quizzed about his knowledge of the National Health Service. ""What is that?"" he replied. Home for Spirescu is the small village of Pelisor, in Transylvania. That is where his wife, Catalina, lives and where she waved him off, wishing him good luck and saying she hoped to see him return ""very soon with a lot of money"". And that is where he intends to return. He is here to earn money to ""renovate my home and make a good life in Romania because it's much easier to live in Romania, because it's not expensive"". Spirescu found himself a job washing cars through a friend. His boss was sorting out his accommodation. He had chosen the UK over Germany because he doesn't speak German: he had previously stayed there for two months, ""but I don't understand anything"". And now he was just a little surprised at his reception. ""Yes, a lot of politicians here. My God. Man, I don't come here to rob your country. I come to work. And you open the borders. I come to work. To make money to go home."" His interrogation by journalists over, he obliged further with a quick photocall with Vaz before disappearing off for his first full day in the UK. Vaz's dawn visit to Luton airport followed evidence to his committee from the Home Office permanent secretary Mark Sedwill about ""Olympic-style"" arrangements being put in place for 1 January  which was followed by evidence from the home secretary, Theresa May, that it would be ""business as usual"". After a behind-the-scenes tour, Vaz confirmed he and Reckless had found no evidence of Olympic-style security. Neither had they witnessed a New Year's Day invasion.

It initially stated that she had two PhDs.</p>",2014,"Trainee doctor Felicia Buruiana first realised the newspaper headlines warning of a tide of Romanian beggars and benefits cheats were starting to intrude on her day-to-day life when patients began taking a keen interest in her background. At first the 37-year-old got ""funny looks"" when she told them she was Romanian because she ""didn't look like a gypsy"". Then, as the political and media rhetoric around Romanian and Bulgarian immigration to the UK grew more toxic, patients' attitudes began to harden. ""There was this certain reaction,"" says Buruiana over a coffee at the end of her shift at her new hospital in Hertfordshire. ""People would tut or pull a face when I said I was Romanian. In the end it was happening all the time and it made things very difficult. I was going home thinking: this is so disappointing, so sad, so tiring. This is not the UK I had got to know."" There are several thousand Romanian and Bulgarians working in the NHS filling key roles from midwives to surgeons. According to the latest GMC figures, 2,140 doctors who qualified in Romania are currently in post in the UK  more than from Australia, Poland or Spain. But as the debate intensified around the lifting of working restrictions for Romanians and Bulgarians on 1 January, many medics who had lived and worked in the UK for years, have experienced an upturn in hostility. Sitting behind his desk at the embassy in west London, the UK's Romanian ambassador, Ion Jinga, points to a pile of print-outs in front of him. They are letters and emails he has recieved in the past few days from Romanians based in the UK who say they are facing growing levels of discrimination. One is from a young dentist who says she was racially abused by a patient who told her: ""Romanians should be working on farms not as dentists."" Jinga looks up from the papers: ""I am really sad to hear these cases of discrimination due, in large part, to the tabloid media campaign and the vilification of Romanians and Bulgarians. I know this attitude is not a characteristic of the British society and therefore I very much hope that the public opinion here will strongly reject and condemn such discriminatory acts."" Campaign groups say the difficulties experienced by NHS workers is part of rising tide of hostility towards immigrants from from Romania and Bulgaria  and warn that things are likely to get worse in the runup to May's European elections. Sitting in a corner of the Great Court at the British Museum in London, Tommy Tomescu, a Romanian dentist who came to the UK in 2010, has decided it is time to fight back. After reading a newspaper article about the numbers of Romanians being arrested early last year Tomescu became so angry at the ""twisting of the facts"" that he set up a a new campaign group, the Alliance Against Romanian and Bulgarian Discrimination. Over the past 12 months  between working as an NHS dentist in West Sussex and volunteering as a lecturer in London once a week  he has waged a vigorous campaign, organising three demonstrations, the last one attracting more than 100 people, presented a petition to David Cameron at 10 Downing Street and lobbied EU officials and heads of state. On Sunday there will be another demonstration in central London in support of the female dentist who said she had been racially abused by a patient who told her that Romanians should only be allowed to work on a farm. ""She started to shake  she was really very upset by this,"" says Tomescu as tourists mill around the museum cafe. Tomescu, 32, came to the UK because of better pay and to further his career, and says he has been exasperated by the way sections of the media and some politicians have whipped up fears about Romanian and Bulgarian immigration. ""We are being used and these people know it is not right but they are doing it anyway because it suits them They just want to be seen doing something against Romanians  that is what they care about in the government. For them  in terms of votes  it is good. But for us and for UK it is not good."" He says headlines like ""How Romanian criminals terrorise our streets"" and ""Benefits Britain here we come"" have left him and his Romanian friends disorientated  and angry. ""What we are seeing in the papers is a different reality,"" he said. ""Suddenly my life, the reality of my life day to day, has been overtaken by this depiction of Romanians as this big scary problem. It is a very frustrating situation."" And he warns that other young, highly skilled Romanians are now thinking twice about coming to what they perceive to be a racist UK. ""I know that is not the real story of this country but that is the impression people in Romania are starting to get."" Tomescu is recovering from the flu and admits that the campaign is taking its toll. ""Sometimes I am tired and I do not feel like all this work but I open another newspaper and I see the same lies again, so I get angry and I feel I must continue what I am doing."" He says he wants to make the British public aware that Romanians and Bulgarians are not a problem for the UK: ""We don't have such a big influence and we have also lots of positive things."" Finishing her coffee, Buruiana, who speaks five foreign languages and has a PhD and two master's degrees, agrees that many Romanians are making a positive contribution to the UK. ""There are so many people like me: honest people paying taxes, doing our best,"" she says. She has now moved to a different hospital and last year she became a British citizen  giving her dual nationality. As she gets ready to leave she insists she remains very fond  and proud  of her adopted country. ""The UK has always been a country to be admired. There are so many people from so many backgrounds and continents and it is a place where we learn to be open-minded and that we are not alone in this world,"" she says. And has her experience in the past 12 months changed her? ""I suppose it has made me react in a way that now I say I am proud to be Romanian, and to say yes, Romanians do look like me.""

Many of those now registered as working were already here, he said, but applied for their National Insurance numbers after 1 January knowing it was now not mandatory to be self-employed. ""Anyone who wanted to come to the UK is already here. They did not really need this lifting restrictions because most were working as self-employed, as doctors, dentists, construction workers, cleaners. ""People will still come, if they want to. Not in the great numbers that Migration Watch said of 500,000 every year. ""We expect an apology. Because of this campaign there has been an increase at the same time in attacks against Polish people, Romanians, Bulgarians, Slovakians.

The country of birth figures will always be higher because they people who have been in the UK a long time and become British.</p> <p>The figures by country of birth show that in January to March 2013 there were 72, 000 Romanians and 40,000 Bulgarians already working in Britain, making a total of 112,000. This rose to 141,000 between April to June last year before falling to 135,000 in July to September before rising again to 144,000 in October to December.

For a more complete view, we will have to wait for the net migration statistics in August which will show what happened to migration flows from the two countries to the UK in the first three months of this year and until May 2015 when the full year net migration figures are published for 2014.</p>",2014,"More than 30,000 extra Romanians and Bulgarians are working in Britain compared with a year ago, official Labour Force Survey figures to be published on Wednesday are expected to show. But this 25%-plus rise in their presence of the British workforce does not represent a surge in migrants from Romania and Bulgaria since the labour market restrictions on them were lifted on 1 January; the bulk of the increase happened before then. Such an apparent surge in the number of Romanians and Bulgarians coming to Britain is likely to prove incendiary within the current febrile political atmosphere of the European elections debate on immigration.

It is possible for him to make that prediction because the numbers to be published by the Office for National Statistics will add a further quarter  January to March 2014  to the previous three-quarters  from April 2013 to December 2013  that are already published. ""These figures will not show how many Romanians and Bulgarians arrived to work in Britain between January and March this year,"" said an ONS spokesman. ""They only show how many were in employment during that period. They do not show when they arrived in Britain.""

The last three quarters will make up 75% of the latest ONS figure and so it can be confidently predicted that the number will be at least 30,000 above the 112,000 estimated in the first quarter of 2013. But the real test of the impact of the abolition of labour market restrictions on these two countries would be to compare the 144,000 figure for October to December 2013  the last quarter of 2013  with the first quarter of 2014. This is likely to be a lower figure but a more accurate reflection of its impact. It would also be rather better to look at the figures for Romanian and Bulgarian nationals rather than those including British citizens who happened to be born in either country. These are slightly lower, with 103,000 in the workforce in January to March 2013 which rose to 125,000 by October to December 2013. It is worth noting that the number of Romanians and Bulgarians should be seen in the overall context of 1.54m EU nationals working in Britain which is similar to number of Britain living or working in other parts of the EU. One thing the Labour Force Survey will not reveal is the main trend within EU migration which was disclosed in the last set of immigration figures : the far more significant movement of migrants from slow-growth economies of Spain, Italy and Greece to the faster growing British economy. The labour market figures do not give a southern Europe/northern Europe breakdown. The new ONS figures also only cover those in work; they do not include family members, students and others who have to live in Britain. For a more complete view, we will have to wait for the net migration statistics in August which will show what happened to migration flows from the two countries to the UK in the first three months of this year and until May 2015 when the full year net migration figures are published for 2014."

The resulting shockwaves destroyed more than 30 high-rise buildings in the Romanian capital as well as thousands of other structures.

The former director of the Romanian National Institute of Historical Monuments points to the metal brackets that were attached to building walls as a quick-fix solution soon after the earthquake struck.

A walk down Calea Victoriei (Victory Avenue) in the heart of the city takes you past former palaces, majestic hotels dating from the turn of the 20th century, and the homes of some of the country<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>s most renowned historical figures, including George Enescu, the country<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>s best-loved composer.</p> <p>But Bucharest is also the most earthquake-prone capital in Europe, affected by numerous small tremors every year <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> and many of its older buildings are in real danger of collapse.</p> <p>In the late 1990s, the Romanian government began a programme of building assessments, placing red circular plaques on buildings that were deemed likely to collapse in an earthquake of magnitude 7 or higher.

They are the victims not only of neglect, but seismic activity. Bucharest is the most dangerous major city in Europe when it comes to earthquakes, Lungu explains. Nearly 40 years ago, an earthquake measuring 7.2 on the Richter scale struck 60 miles away from Bucharest. The resulting shockwaves destroyed more than 30 high-rise buildings in the Romanian capital as well as thousands of other structures. An estimated 1,578 people were killed with a further 11,000 injured. It was one of the most devastating events in recent Romanian history. In that 1977 quake, 33 [high-rise] buildings in Bucharest were completely destroyed, but many others were damaged, says Lungu. The former director of the Romanian National Institute of Historical Monuments points to the metal brackets that were attached to building walls as a quick-fix solution soon after the earthquake struck. The fact those brackets are still there today, and that little has been done to shore up these heritage buildings, is of major concern to Lungu and others trying to protect both the city and its structures. Bucharest is a beautiful and little-known European city, with an historic heart full of crumbling, ornate, early 20th-century buildings. A walk down Calea Victoriei (Victory Avenue) in the heart of the city takes you past former palaces, majestic hotels dating from the turn of the 20th century, and the homes of some of the countrys most renowned historical figures, including George Enescu, the countrys best-loved composer. But Bucharest is also the most earthquake-prone capital in Europe, affected by numerous small tremors every year  and many of its older buildings are in real danger of collapse. In the late 1990s, the Romanian government began a programme of building assessments, placing red circular plaques on buildings that were deemed likely to collapse in an earthquake of magnitude 7 or higher. The idea was to identify the buildings so that efforts could be made to preserve them and protect their inhabitants, with residents being given interest-free loans to carry out the necessary repairs. To date, 374 buildings in the heart of the old city (containing as many as 2,700 apartments) have been classified as Class I risk. Many are still inhabited by long-term residents; people seeking cheap rent or those unable to afford to live elsewhere in the capital. Rents can be a third less in these buildings than in neighbouring apartments. The testing process was begun at the request of the apartments residents, who then quickly realised the negatives of owning property in a building with a red spot. Repair loans would only be awarded if every homeowner in the building agreed  if just one resident refused, the building would still be given a red spot without any way to remove it. People realised it was pointless, that property prices would go down. There have been no more than 17 requests for red spot tests since 2000. If people see the spot, the price lowers and it is harder to sell, says Lungu, adding that many residents have removed the plaques from the sides of their buildings. Probably nearly all of the buildings in Bucharests old town should have red spots, he adds, almost as an afterthought. Sitting in her apartment on the fourth floor of a 1930s tenement building, 34-year-old Daniela Turcu says she fell in love with Bucharests old architecture soon after arriving in the city a year ago  but is now planning to move from her building, which has a prominent red plaque on it. It is cheap and everywhere in the city centre is so expensive, but after one of last years bigger earthquakes I got scared, the 34-year-old Romanian artist says. Im not sure if I am being paranoid, but it is just not worth the risk. Turcu says few of the owners or landlords here bother spending money to do up the apartments, when there is a chance that the building could fall down or become uninhabitable after the next major earthquake hits  whenever that is. According to Nicusor Dan, a 45-year-old mathematics professor who moved to the city as a 20-year-old and eventually set up his own small NGO to protect Bucharests heritage architecture, the fact the buildings are now nearly 40 years older, yet have had little done to preserve them, means that if an earthquake happens again similar to 1977, we can expect an even greater number of deaths. Dan estimates there are around a thousand historical buildings in danger in Bucharest, with just 26 having been strengthened in the past 20 years. The buildings most at danger are the high-rises built between the wars, he says. Many of these buildings still bear the scars of the earthquake in 1977. Despite his mathematical background, Dan declines to offer odds on the next quake happening soon  but says his logical thinking comes in useful when preparing to go to court to try to get yet another building placed on the heritage list, or protected from demolition. When a house is destroyed, I resent it very strongly, he says. Hundreds of buildings dating from the early 20th century remain empty across Bucharest, having been allowed to fall into disrepair. In the pedestrian heart of the city, where revellers sit at cafe and bar terraces in the evenings, some buildings have wire-mesh netting to try to protect passersby from any falling masonry. Critics say a significant number of these historic buildings could be strengthened, rejuvenated and saved  but that the owners prefer to leave them empty, waiting until it is necessary to tear them down for safety reasons and then, in their place, building a modern high-rise. A get-rich-quick mentality has been responsible for much of the destruction of Old Bucharest, says Roxana Wring, founder of the Association for the Protection and Documentation of Listed Monuments and Heritage of Romania. There is not even a beginning of a modern approach to what it means to preserve the cultural landscape in Bucharest.  Wring suggests the local authorities need to treat the citys historic buildings in a holistic way, rather than as a set of disparate objects that can be replaced by modern buildings which are, often, in stark contrast to the historical character of the neighbourhoods. Urban regeneration and conservation can only be created with decent regulations, says Wring. There is no political will to change things related to heritage. Some of Bucharests older buildings have stood empty for years; others are being aided in their deterioration at night through strategic vandalism. Once they reach a certain stage of disrepair, the owners will have no choice but to finish the job. In the meantime, they are dangerous shells of buildings that could easily fall on those passing by, with or without the help of an earthquake. It is impossible to predict when the next major quake could happen, says Lungu, as we continue our walk around the old city centre. A similar magnitude earthquake to the one that occurred in 1977 happens every 50 to 100 years. And so, people in Bucharest must go on living in and around dilapidated buildings that are at serious seismic risk.

Is this really how you see us?

According to UK labour market statistics, 121,500 Romanians and Bulgarians were working in Britain last month: as part of fixed quotas in food-processing and agriculture, by simply registering as self-employed or <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> for the more highly skilled <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> on permits applied for by an employer.</p> <p>""The people who really wanted to leave have mostly left by now,"" says Raluca Apostol, 25, who did a one-year masters in marketing at Portsmouth in 2011 and will go back next year if she finds a better job than the one she has in Bucharest. ""It's not a question any more of 'Hey, I can go now, so I think I will.' Most already went. And it was easy to stay.""</p> <p>It's a view you hear repeated often. In Sofia, a young web developer called Slavo Ingilizov has already found his London job, starting in mid-January. He's moving because, while he has a very good post with a Bulgarian IT company consistently voted the country's best employer, he wanted to be somewhere smaller, sharper, where what he says counts for more.</p> <p>Ingilizov will double his pay but knows his outgoings will be three or even four times higher: ""This is about the job, not the disposable cash. I won't be much better off."" He, too, sees no imminent exodus <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> despite an average monthly wage in Bulgaria of only <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><80><9a><c3><82><c2><ac>400 (<c3><83><e2><80><9a><c3><82><c2><a3>330). ""It won't be massive,"" Ingilizov says. ""This isn't the border opening, it's a simplified procedure for working. Some people live so poorly here it was a no-brainer to go; no restrictions would stop them, and they went. But I haven't heard a single person say: 'God, I'm just waiting for 1 January.'""</p> <p>Mila Korsakova, who aims to study product or graphic design in London and work there afterwards, agrees: ""Moving is still a big deal. You have to be desperate or highly motivated, and if you were one of those, why would you have waited?""</p> <p>The two countries do expect a rise in the number of their citizens registered in Britain but they believe much of that increase will come from people ""regularising"" their situations: those nominally illegally or self-employed builders, drivers, receptionists, and waiters who had the working practices of employees but none of the protections.</p> <p>But an invasion? They don't see it happening here. In Romania, journalists such as Mihai Radu recall news items about busloads of workers leaving for Birmingham building sites, Norfolk food-processing factories or vegetable farms in Lincolnshire. ""But that was 2007,"" he says, ""and there are no more buses leaving now than did back then.""</p> <p>Ion Ciornihac aims to be on one of them, though, if his mate Cornel Mihai, flush with a bit of cash after working in building supplies in New York, succeeds in getting a small agency off the ground to bring painters, plasterers and tilers to work on UK building sites.</p> <p>But Ciornihac would not leave on his own, without the security of an agency and a sure job. ""I don't even know how to ask for a loaf of bread in English,"" he says. Earning <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><80><9a><c3><82><c2><ac>22 a day on building sites around Bucharest, Ciornihac has, unsurprisingly, already done similar such stints abroad: a year in Spain a while back, two three-month contracts in Germany.""I'll go as long as the money is guaranteed,"" he says; he's currently insulating a block of flats but hasn't been paid for a month <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> the council hasn't paid the contractor, the contractor isn't paying the workers. ""I'm not living, I'm surviving,"" he says. Between them, Ciornihac and his wife, a cook, are lucky to clear 700 euros a month.</p> <p>Would he settle abroad? ""No,"" he says. ""I'm Romanian, and I want to live in Romania. My wife won't leave, anyway, so it will be just me, just for the money. There'll be others like me, but no more than before, and we'll come back. We go there to work, if there are jobs for us to do.""</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-image-425790582""> <img src=""https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/26/1388089447325/Nicu-Romania-011.jpg"" alt=""Nicu Romania"" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">For workers like Nicu, a builder, British salaries seem very appealing. Photograph: Bogdan Croitoru</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In some more highly qualified sectors, the numbers moving have already peaked. Laurentiu Marc, who runs the Bucharest office of a medical recruitment agency, says he was once finding British jobs for 1,000 Romanian doctors, dentists and pharmacists a year. In 2011, the General Medical Council registered 450 Romanian doctors to work in Britain, the third highest total after India and Pakistan.</p> <p>A junior doctor in Romania can expect to earn <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><80><9a><c3><82><c2><ac>300 a month, against <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><80><9a><c3><82><c2><ac>2,500 in Britain. ""But in 2012 the number of Romanian doctors coming to us hit a plateau,"" says Marc, ""and there's been no upswing ahead of January 1. Those who wanted to leave have already left.""</p> <p>Officials here also note that unlike in 2004, eight other EU countries besides Britain <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> including Austria, Belgium, France, Germany and the Netherlands <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> will be lifting controls on Romanian and Bulgarian workers next month, so Britain's pull factor should be weaker. Br<c3><83><c6><92><c3><82><c2><a2>ndua Predescu at the foreign ministry points out that Romanians actually started emigrating with the fall of the Ceausescu regime, and the trend continued through the country's steady progression towards full EU membership.</p> <p>""Even in 2007, there was not what you would call an exodus,"" Predescu says. ""Many Romanian families have found jobs abroad since 1990."" Large Romanian communities <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> 1 million and 1.5 million strong and into their second generation <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> have existed for 20 years in Spain and Italy, where Latin languages and cultures made integration easier. Perhaps half a million are in Germany.</p> <p>So how many more are likely to leave now? Especially, Predescu notes that ""the Romanian economy continued to grow throughout the crisis; levels of general wealth are rising; Romania is attracting more and more foreign investors&#xa0;<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><c2><a6> The temptation to leave en masse is falling. We do not really understand these British fears.""</p> <p>Nor do people here understand the notion that any more than a tiny number of people might move to a foreign country simply to claim benefits. ""It's a crazy idea,"" says Nasko Stoikov, a trainee auditor in Sofia. ""Why would anyone want to do that? I've never even thought about benefits. If people go, of course it's to work, to contribute.""</p> <p>According to the Romanian foreign ministry, more than 70% of Romanians in Britain are aged between 18 and 35, while child benefit claims by Romanian families in Britain amount to 0.8% of the total for families from the European Economic Area.</p> <p>There is broad acceptance <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> even support <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> for Britain's last-minute moves to tighten benefit rules. ""I don't think any reasonable person would object to a three-month qualification period, or longer,"" says Valentina Ivan, who spent a year in Edinburgh. ""If people really are going to the UK to live on benefits, it's because they know they can get away with it. So reform your system: insist everyone must contribute, for several months, before they can claim.""</p> <p>Some members of Romania's Roma community may, people claim, be a cause for concern. Like many here, Marius Todea and Cristina Matache from Bucharest's Saint Sava high school, who hope to study at British universities next year, are eager to draw a distinction. ""It's partly our fault; we've failed to integrate the Roma community,"" says Todea. ""I'm not prejudiced; they have their way of life. Some do go abroad and do unpleasant things. But people abroad should not confuse Roma and Romanians.""</p> <p>As long as national laws are obeyed, the fundamental European right to freedom of movement must be upheld. That is what counts here <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> and as Britain grapples with its Eurosceptic demons, Romanians and Bulgarians fear freedom is threatened. ""Verify, check, clamp down, tighten up, plug the holes in your systems all you like,"" says Andrei, 31, in Bucharest, who asked not to be further identified. ""But please, don't touch freedom of movement within the EU.</p> <p>""This was our parents' dream; even 25 years ago you couldn't imagine it. My dad has a friend who jumped in the Danube, to get to France. So don't stop working people moving. Don't stop them filling vacancies that need to be filled.""</p> <p>Cutting down on free movement, says Radu Tatucu, who spent 11 years in the US, would ""go against the whole spirit of the EU. Bringing down the barriers was the whole point <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><c2><a6> I'd like to believe they've been lowered for good.

""That little line at the bottom of the job ads, you know? The one that says: 'Apply only if you are eligible to work in the UK.' We won't need to worry about it any more. Because, well, we will be. Eligible."" An engaging 23-year-old with a first-class computer sciences degree from Essex University, Vernescu came back to Romania last year to look after an ailing aunt who had put some of her savings towards his studies. He found a job on a good salary  600 a month, as much as his parents earn together  with a small but thriving local app developer, moved into a flat with two friends, and was doing fine until the company, through no real fault of its own, lost a couple of key clients. So now, along with what some in the UK fear will be multitudes of fellow Romanians and Bulgarians, he's coming to Britain. With his skills, in his field  ""Software development; any kind really. I'm pretty handy""  he expects no difficulty finding a job paying three times what he made in Bucharest. How many like Horia Vernescu will jump on a 50 flight to Britain next year, and stay? Haunted by the memory of the half-million Polish workers who arrived in 2004 when it had predicted a mere 13,000, the government declines to hazard even a guess. Meanwhile, Eurosceptic Tory MPs predict more than 400,000 from the two nations will be living in Britain in a few years. The campaign group MigrationWatch, which lobbies for immigration limits, expects 50,000-70,000 Romanians and Bulgarians to come every year for the first five years. The Migration Matters Trust, a cross-party campaign that challenges the ""anti-immigration consensus"", believes the figure will peak at 20,000 a year. So a nervous coalition government has rushed out measures making new arrivals wait longer before they can claim benefits  and, more controversially, is calling for a wider debate on the principle of free movement within the European Union and perhaps even an EU migration cap. Talking to students, professionals, labourers and government officials in Bucharest and Sofia, things look less dramatic. Concrete predictions are a fool's game, but very few here foresee a flood of emigrants  or believe benefit scroungers exist in statistically meaningful numbers. Pretty much everyone, on the other hand, who reads a newspaper or watches TV says they feel shocked by their portrayal. Elena Ghita, seeking to move to Britain  or the US, Canada or Australia  as an operations manager ideally for a start-up, says: ""It makes you angry. And ashamed, for the first time, to be Romanian. We know our flaws. But when you're attacked so  dishonestly... Is this really how you see us? Beggars and thieves?"" People point out here that Bulgarians and Romanians have been able to travel visa-free to Britain since their countries joined the EU in 2007  and that the temporary restrictions stopped very few from working. According to UK labour market statistics, 121,500 Romanians and Bulgarians were working in Britain last month: as part of fixed quotas in food-processing and agriculture, by simply registering as self-employed or  for the more highly skilled  on permits applied for by an employer. ""The people who really wanted to leave have mostly left by now,"" says Raluca Apostol, 25, who did a one-year masters in marketing at Portsmouth in 2011 and will go back next year if she finds a better job than the one she has in Bucharest. ""It's not a question any more of 'Hey, I can go now, so I think I will.' Most already went. And it was easy to stay."" It's a view you hear repeated often. In Sofia, a young web developer called Slavo Ingilizov has already found his London job, starting in mid-January. He's moving because, while he has a very good post with a Bulgarian IT company consistently voted the country's best employer, he wanted to be somewhere smaller, sharper, where what he says counts for more. Ingilizov will double his pay but knows his outgoings will be three or even four times higher: ""This is about the job, not the disposable cash. I won't be much better off."" He, too, sees no imminent exodus  despite an average monthly wage in Bulgaria of only 400 (330). ""It won't be massive,"" Ingilizov says. ""This isn't the border opening, it's a simplified procedure for working. Some people live so poorly here it was a no-brainer to go; no restrictions would stop them, and they went. But I haven't heard a single person say: 'God, I'm just waiting for 1 January.'"" Mila Korsakova, who aims to study product or graphic design in London and work there afterwards, agrees: ""Moving is still a big deal. You have to be desperate or highly motivated, and if you were one of those, why would you have waited?"" The two countries do expect a rise in the number of their citizens registered in Britain but they believe much of that increase will come from people ""regularising"" their situations: those nominally illegally or self-employed builders, drivers, receptionists, and waiters who had the working practices of employees but none of the protections. But an invasion? They don't see it happening here. In Romania, journalists such as Mihai Radu recall news items about busloads of workers leaving for Birmingham building sites, Norfolk food-processing factories or vegetable farms in Lincolnshire. ""But that was 2007,"" he says, ""and there are no more buses leaving now than did back then."" Ion Ciornihac aims to be on one of them, though, if his mate Cornel Mihai, flush with a bit of cash after working in building supplies in New York, succeeds in getting a small agency off the ground to bring painters, plasterers and tilers to work on UK building sites. But Ciornihac would not leave on his own, without the security of an agency and a sure job. ""I don't even know how to ask for a loaf of bread in English,"" he says. Earning 22 a day on building sites around Bucharest, Ciornihac has, unsurprisingly, already done similar such stints abroad: a year in Spain a while back, two three-month contracts in Germany.""I'll go as long as the money is guaranteed,"" he says; he's currently insulating a block of flats but hasn't been paid for a month  the council hasn't paid the contractor, the contractor isn't paying the workers. ""I'm not living, I'm surviving,"" he says. Between them, Ciornihac and his wife, a cook, are lucky to clear 700 euros a month. Would he settle abroad? ""No,"" he says. ""I'm Romanian, and I want to live in Romania. My wife won't leave, anyway, so it will be just me, just for the money. There'll be others like me, but no more than before, and we'll come back. We go there to work, if there are jobs for us to do."" In some more highly qualified sectors, the numbers moving have already peaked. Laurentiu Marc, who runs the Bucharest office of a medical recruitment agency, says he was once finding British jobs for 1,000 Romanian doctors, dentists and pharmacists a year. In 2011, the General Medical Council registered 450 Romanian doctors to work in Britain, the third highest total after India and Pakistan. A junior doctor in Romania can expect to earn 300 a month, against 2,500 in Britain. ""But in 2012 the number of Romanian doctors coming to us hit a plateau,"" says Marc, ""and there's been no upswing ahead of January 1. Those who wanted to leave have already left."" Officials here also note that unlike in 2004, eight other EU countries besides Britain  including Austria, Belgium, France, Germany and the Netherlands  will be lifting controls on Romanian and Bulgarian workers next month, so Britain's pull factor should be weaker. Brndua Predescu at the foreign ministry points out that Romanians actually started emigrating with the fall of the Ceausescu regime, and the trend continued through the country's steady progression towards full EU membership. ""Even in 2007, there was not what you would call an exodus,"" Predescu says. ""Many Romanian families have found jobs abroad since 1990."" Large Romanian communities  1 million and 1.5 million strong and into their second generation  have existed for 20 years in Spain and Italy, where Latin languages and cultures made integration easier. Perhaps half a million are in Germany. So how many more are likely to leave now? Especially, Predescu notes that ""the Romanian economy continued to grow throughout the crisis; levels of general wealth are rising; Romania is attracting more and more foreign investors The temptation to leave en masse is falling. We do not really understand these British fears."" Nor do people here understand the notion that any more than a tiny number of people might move to a foreign country simply to claim benefits. ""It's a crazy idea,"" says Nasko Stoikov, a trainee auditor in Sofia. ""Why would anyone want to do that? I've never even thought about benefits. If people go, of course it's to work, to contribute."" According to the Romanian foreign ministry, more than 70% of Romanians in Britain are aged between 18 and 35, while child benefit claims by Romanian families in Britain amount to 0.8% of the total for families from the European Economic Area. There is broad acceptance  even support  for Britain's last-minute moves to tighten benefit rules. ""I don't think any reasonable person would object to a three-month qualification period, or longer,"" says Valentina Ivan, who spent a year in Edinburgh. ""If people really are going to the UK to live on benefits, it's because they know they can get away with it. So reform your system: insist everyone must contribute, for several months, before they can claim."" Some members of Romania's Roma community may, people claim, be a cause for concern. Like many here, Marius Todea and Cristina Matache from Bucharest's Saint Sava high school, who hope to study at British universities next year, are eager to draw a distinction. ""It's partly our fault; we've failed to integrate the Roma community,"" says Todea. ""I'm not prejudiced; they have their way of life. Some do go abroad and do unpleasant things. But people abroad should not confuse Roma and Romanians."" As long as national laws are obeyed, the fundamental European right to freedom of movement must be upheld. That is what counts here  and as Britain grapples with its Eurosceptic demons, Romanians and Bulgarians fear freedom is threatened. ""Verify, check, clamp down, tighten up, plug the holes in your systems all you like,"" says Andrei, 31, in Bucharest, who asked not to be further identified. ""But please, don't touch freedom of movement within the EU. ""This was our parents' dream; even 25 years ago you couldn't imagine it. My dad has a friend who jumped in the Danube, to get to France. So don't stop working people moving. Don't stop them filling vacancies that need to be filled."" Cutting down on free movement, says Radu Tatucu, who spent 11 years in the US, would ""go against the whole spirit of the EU. Bringing down the barriers was the whole point  I'd like to believe they've been lowered for good. I'd hate some politician to try to raise them again for the sake of 2% more votes."" The Romanians and Bulgarians arriving in Britain next year will include students like Todea, labourers like Ciornihac, high-skilled, hi-tech specialists like Vernescu and Ingilzov. But they will also, most likely, include quite a few like Iuliana Stefan, a 32-year-old civil engineer. After a fruitful few years in Bucharest during the mid-2000s boom, Stefan has a job but has not been paid since August. She is not sure of finding work in Britain in her chosen profession; her qualifications may not transfer. So she'll settle for office management, and failing that, for almost anything: her sister, back in Romania to have her baby after a bad experience with the NHS, paid a recruiter back in 2007, went on a course, and got one of those ""self-employed"" jobs in a restaurant in Yorkshire. But whatever Stefan ends up doing, ""I won't have to pay, and I won't need a permit. So it will just be that little bit easier. And I think most of us going now, next year, will be like this: young, highly qualified, wanting to work hard, do well But perhaps that's harder for Britain to deal with than a flood of benefit scroungers."""

The frequent calls, to five Romanian numbers, suddenly stopped after Saad al-Hilli, 50, his wife, Iqbal, 47, and her mother, Suhaila al-Allaf, 74, were gunned down near Lake Annecy in the Haute Savoie last September, say police. Each victim was shot twice in the head, leading investigators to suspect a contract killing. Since then they have also looked at whether the murders could have been carried out by a lone assassin with no connection to the family. On Monday the Annecy public prosecutor, Eric Maillaud, confirmed that detectives had asked the Romanian authorities to trace the telephone numbers following calls allegedly made to and from the home of Hilli's brother Zaid in the three weeks before the family left for a holiday in France. ""We believe the brother was in contact with Romania and we are looking to identify the calls. We would like to know why he was calling people in Romania,"" Maillaud told the Guardian.""We have made an official request to the Romanians to verify the numbers."" Maillaud said so far they had not been traced, but insisted it was not a ""firm lead"" into the murders. ""We are just leaving no stone unturned,"" he added. The prosecutor said he was unable to confirm reports in Le Parisien that Mrs Hilli's sister Fadwa al-Saffar also made calls to Romania from her home in Reading. The investigation into the shootings has led French detectives, working with British counterparts, to make inquiries in various corners of the world, including Iraq, the former Yugoslavia and Switzerland. Nine months on, however, they are no closer to apprehending the killer or killers. A passing cyclist, Frenchman Sylvain Mollier, 45, a father-of-three who appeared to have stumbled across the scene, was also murdered. Police focused on Zaid al-Hilli after family friends told detectives that the two brothers had been engaged in a family inheritance dispute, but Zaid al-Hilli has repeatedly denied any feud. The Hillis' two daughters were the only survivors of the shooting. The older girl, Zainab, aged seven, was shot in the shoulder and beaten around the head, leaving her with a fractured skull. Her sister, Zeena, four, escaped uninjured after hiding for eight hours in the rear footwell of the family's BMW 5-series estate under the skirt of her dead mother. The two girls are reportedly in the care of a foster family."

Take a bus from the town of Santamaria-Orlea, hop off when the locals tell you, and you will be enthralled by the size of the site: it has every building a Roman settlement should have. If that is not enough, a short walk down country lanes brings you to beautiful Unesco-listed Densus church, made from stones probably taken from a Roman mausoleum.cimec.ro majones SibiuAdmire icons and Romanian impressionists in Sibiu's Brukenthal Museum (brukenthalmuseum.ro) on Piata Mare (Big Square). Stroll to the nearby Liars' Bridge, Romania's oldest cast-iron bridge, said to collapse if you tell a lie when standing on it. Visit the 14th-century evangelical church, where the son of Vlad the Impaler was stabbed. Stay at the elegant Hotel Imparatul Romanilor.imparatulromanilor.ro, doubles 45busylizzie51 Saxon villages If you're visiting Sighisoara and Sibiu, take a bus to some of the Saxon villages of Trnava Mare. Most towns preserve their history with names in Romanian, German and Hungarian. Settlements such as Biertan (also called Birthlm or Berethalom) and Richis (Reichersdorf, Riomfalva) boast extraordinary fortified churches, sleepy monasteries and a tangible sense of the past. discovertarnavamare.orgestragno Christmas Market, SibiuA small Christmas Market is held in the beautiful setting of Sibiu's central square. It is straight out of Ruritanian romance, and there's a very good chance that there will be snow to add to the atmosphere. There are plenty of cosy cafes around the square and the glhwein was only 60p a glass. We stayed at Casa Luxembourg in the centre, which was both comfortable and very reasonable.casaluxemburg.ro, doubles from 50tireeandcoll2 SighisoaraIn a forest near Sighisoara, we found ammonites in a forest stream, saw really beautiful insects, and picked and ate delicious wild raspberries with our picnic, which included the ubiquitous strong plum spirit. The raspberries were also sold at the roadside by gypsy women and girls along with baskets of fungi. In the middle of nowhere on a wooded hill we came across an American archeology professor plus students excavating a fourth-century Hunnish settlement. And as we crossed a stream on the way back, there glistening in the mud was the very recently formed spoor of a large brown bear. Casa Cu Cerb (casacucerb.ro/en) in the medieval citadel does amazing pork dishes. apetergill Liberty Bear Sanctuary, BrasovThis bear rescue centre is a wonderful experience. It is 5km outside a town called Zarnesti, easily reached by train from Brasov: you will need a taxi from Zarnesti. Book in advance: they need a minimum of 10 visitors. You will see bears (60 to 70) that have awful histories but are now living in a safe and happy environment. ampbears.robearski ViscriViscri is a pretty Saxon village north-west of Brasov with a fortified church that's a Unesco world heritage site (climb the tower for great views). Many Saxon buildings have been restored and a traditional way of life endures  the cows are driven to the fields in the early morning, returning in the evening, and people use horses and carts. You can stay in a guesthouse belonging to Prince Charles.transylvaniancastle.comjlvcardiff Nomad Camp, VrmezoThe Nomad camp is in an idyllic small village in Transylvania, away from the distractions of modern life. The restaurant serves delicious traditional fare including fresh fish from the camp's lake. It's a million miles away from English camping: you spend the night snuggled up in a luxurious yurt with a log fire and animal skin rug. Cleanse your skin and your soul as you bathe in the camp's salt bath, or treat yourself to a massage. It's a comfortable and completely unique experience, and great value (B&B 15pppn).+40 746 777 043, nomadcamp.eubla2591 Valea Verde, near SighisoaraMy parents took me to this complex of restored farmhouses when I was 14 and very interested in eastern Europe. We arrived to gorgeous rolling countryside, with wildlife including golden oriole and eagles. This Saxon/Romanian village was friendly and tranquil, and Valea Verde was run on an easygoing basis that helped support the community. The food was excellent, especially the veranda breakfast. The traditional ways, solid churches and castles were a fascinating contrast to the relics of communism. discover-transilvania.comsamboyd Cisnadioaran, near SibiuDi and Jez provide a fully inclusive stay in this traditional Saxon village with its storks, howling dogs and unmade roads. Di's food is outstanding, and the highlight are the tours, tailored to what you want to see, from salt mines to mountain peaks, remote hill walks, bustling markets, historic towns ... and they even collect you from the airport.

As a Romanian living in Sheffield, I know people are already worrying whether my compatriots are going to swamp this island on New Year's Day. Not long ago my neighbour called over the fence to ask: ""How many more of you lot are heading this way, then?"" She was surprised when I said I didn't know. The truth is that no one knows. As a spokesman for the Foreign Office told me this week: ""There are no reliable statistics about the number of expected Romanians in the UK. It is a complicated issue involving a number of factors, and any figures would only be a guess."" I decided to take a trip home recently to try to answer my neighbour's question with a more educated guess. First I met Ion Cristoiu, one of the best-known journalists in Romania, the founder of several newspapers and a producer of TV political broadcasts.

It was always my dream to come to Britain because of the education system, and now I live with them and their little boy while they support me financially.</p> <p>Of course I understand why some British people feel nervous about Romanians being able to work freely in Britain. My brother-in-law feels the same. From the first day he came to England he started to work and paid taxes; he and my sister have always paid tax and have never claimed benefits. He says, ""I don't want those poor people to come from Romania to take benefits.""

Secondly, there were some important changes in Romanian education law that worked against me. Surprisingly, I found it was easier for me to enter the academic world here than in Romania.</p> <p>In my opinion, very little will change after January 2014 when the working restrictions are lifted for us. It will make no difference financially for those who take cash in hand, and it doesn't greatly affect professionals who already have a work permit. Most Romanians come to England only if they have already secured a job through their contacts here. It's extremely rare for a Romanian to come to the UK, stay at home for three to six months, learn the language, establish contacts and start applying for jobs, because it is simply too expensive.</p>",2013,"It probably sounds silly, but the reason I came to Britain has a lot to do with the Premier League  I'm a huge follower of Manchester United.

Unfortunately, although they had promised to sort out the paperwork, a year later they had a phonecall from the Home Office and fired a couple of Romanians and Bulgarians. I wasn't entirely aware of the work restrictions when I came. My idea was that if I hadn't found a job I would work as a freelance, which is what I am doing now. It took me two months to get my first commission, but I've been working fairly continuously since. I haven't felt any sort of personal discrimination, but I am offended by the way Romanians are portrayed in the British media. Wouldn't you be? We are all offended, and we are trying to prove that we don't only want to come to steal and beg. But unfortunately our reach isn't as big as the Daily Mail. Initially I thought I would come for four or five years, and I still think that. Just because Britain is not a place I would like to grow older. No offence, but you could do with better weather in this country. My brother-in-law and sister came five years ago from Romania. He is an HGV driver and has a yellow card, which means he can work self-employed; she works in Tesco. It was always my dream to come to Britain because of the education system, and now I live with them and their little boy while they support me financially. Of course I understand why some British people feel nervous about Romanians being able to work freely in Britain. My brother-in-law feels the same. From the first day he came to England he started to work and paid taxes; he and my sister have always paid tax and have never claimed benefits. He says, ""I don't want those poor people to come from Romania to take benefits."" I really want the government to tighten up the law on that. Some people don't seem to realise that not all Romanians are the same, but there are some people from our country who even we don't like. They ruin our reputation. I firstcame to the UK in 2009 to pursue a masters degree in linguistics. Like many other Romanians, I come from a humble background and felt that the UK would offer more opportunities. Secondly, there were some important changes in Romanian education law that worked against me. Surprisingly, I found it was easier for me to enter the academic world here than in Romania. In my opinion, very little will change after January 2014 when the working restrictions are lifted for us. It will make no difference financially for those who take cash in hand, and it doesn't greatly affect professionals who already have a work permit. Most Romanians come to England only if they have already secured a job through their contacts here. It's extremely rare for a Romanian to come to the UK, stay at home for three to six months, learn the language, establish contacts and start applying for jobs, because it is simply too expensive."

""Why has it taken him eight months to copy Labour's proposal to make the habitual residence test stronger and clearer?</p> <p>""After Labour proposed this change in March, the government said it was all fine and nothing needed to change. Yet now, rather than following a coherent plan, they are flailing around.

We have failed to do this.""</p>",2013,"Labour has accused David Cameron of panicking over measures to curb benefits for migrants before controls on Bulgarian and Romanian workers are lifted in the new year. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said the government was ""flailing around"" with its proposals to limit unemployment and housing benefit for new arrivals and bar for 12 months migrants who have been deported for begging or sleeping rough. She said public confidence in Cameron's handling of the issue has collapsed, as he had rushed out the measures before the restrictions are lifted on 1 January without thinking them through. ""The prime minister is playing catchup,"" she said. ""Why has it taken him eight months to copy Labour's proposal to make the habitual residence test stronger and clearer? ""After Labour proposed this change in March, the government said it was all fine and nothing needed to change. Yet now, rather than following a coherent plan, they are flailing around. No wonder public confidence in the government's handling of this issue has collapsed."" A senior Labour source also pointed out more than 40 Tory backbenchers are launching an attempt to amend the immigration bill in an effort to guard against an influx of Romanian and Bulgarian citizens next year. ""The prime minister is acting because he faces a Christmas nightmare of Conservative backbenchers rebelling,"" the Labour source said. ""He is not taking considered and thoughtful measures to deal with immigration, he is just panicking. It is ridiculous and farcical to try to blame Labour when the Tories agreed to the accession treaties. This is not clearing up Labour mess, he is clearing up Conservative problems."" However, Theresa May, the home secretary, accused Labour of ""absolutely staggering"" hypocrisy over the issue of immigration. Waving a copy of the Daily Mail in the House of Commons, she said the opposition had no right to lecture the coalition about immigration when it let a million workers from Poland and other eastern European countries come to the UK in the last round of accession. She said many of the proposed measures would be in place before the controls on Bulgaria and Romania are lifted on 1 January, including the bar on deported migrants and the six-month limit on new migrants claiming jobseeker's allowance. The home secretary said there was a growing coalition of support among EU member countries to stop unqualified freedom of movement within the bloc. Cameron's proposals have been greeted by dismay in Brussels, with Lszl Andor, the EU employment commissioner, saying they risked Britain being seen abroad as a ""nasty country"". The senior official said the prime minister's efforts to outlaw so-called benefit tourism were the product of hysteria, and an ""unfortunate overreaction"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he also suggested Cameron was misleading the public about the potential scale of immigration from Bulgaria and Romania. ""The unilateral rhetoric is not really helpful, because it risks presenting the UK as a nasty country in the European Union. We don't want that,"" he said. Cameron's official spokesman said the government would press on regardless of any objections or legal action from the EU. ""This is what we're going to do,"" he said, adding: ""We're not the only country to see free movement as a qualified right."" Under the prime minister's proposals, there would be a ban on new arrivals claiming housing benefit and a three-month wait before they could claim jobseeker's allowance. The move would require some secondary legislation, while higher fines for employers paying less than the minimum wage would require new primary legislation. In an article for the Financial Times, Cameron said he shared the deep concerns of many people in Britain at the EU's requirement to lift transitional controls on Romanians and Bulgarians in January, and blamed ""monumental"" mishandling of the issue by the previous Labour government. The lifting of transitional controls on Bulgarians and Romanians entering the UK has prompted anxiety about the numbers likely to come and opinion polls showing that most Britons want migrants from the two countries barred from working. In the package, Cameron announced:  No newly arrived EU jobseekers will be able to claim housing benefit.  No EU migrant will be entitled to out-of-work benefits for the first three months. In line with a previous announcement, from January no EU migrant will be able to claim jobseeker's allowance (JSA) for more than a maximum of six months unless they can prove that they have a genuine prospect of employment.  A new minimum-earnings threshold will be introduced before benefits such as income support can be claimed.  Any EU national sleeping rough or begging will be deported and barred from re-entry for 12 months ""unless they can prove they have a proper reason to be here, such as a job"". Asked why the proposals had been rushed out just weeks before 1 January, Downing Street said the plans had been under consideration for some time. He said the six-month limit on claiming benefits without a genuine prospect of employment and 12-month bar on re-entry of deported migrants would be in place before the restrictions on Bulgarian and Romanian citizens were lifted. The Liberal Democrats have agreed to the measures, saying they are reasonable and sensible. However, Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, said voters would not believe the measures were tough enough. ""It doesn't sound very tough to me, because under his proposals somebody could come here on 1 January from Romania and within 12 weeks be entitled to unemployment benefit,"" he said. ""I think that's outrageous, I wouldn't call that tough. I would still say that we're being far too generous, even if he does have the guts to put this in place."" In contrast, Keith Vaz, the Labour MP who chairs the Commons home affairs committee, criticised aspects of the proposed welfare sanctions. ""The government is right to deal with the issue of abuse of benefits. However, it is wrong to do so just to target certain communities,"" he said. ""As EU members, we cannot have freedom of movement without the movement. ""These appear to be panic measures which ignore the fact that we cannot control migration from the EU.

Mariana Campeanu, Romanian minister for labour, was in no mood to mince her words last week.</p> <p>Once again, as in 2007 when her country joined the EU, her country's workers are at the centre of a debate in Britain about the threat of benefit-seeking immigrants, fuelled by comments and briefings by government ministers keen for an easy headline, and apocalyptic statistics from Migration Watch about what will happen in 2014 when restrictions on working are lifted for Bulgarians and Romanians.</p> <p>Seated in her large tatty Bucharest office, in what was once the Communist Central Committee Building where Nicolae Ceausescu made his fateful speech in 1989 from a balcony looking over what would become known as Revolutionary Square, Campeanu reeled off a list of statistics and appeals to common sense: Britain is behind Italy, Spain, France, Portugal and Germany as targets for her people. Those who wanted to live abroad now do so, with a million Romanians each in Italy and Spain. There are at most about 150,000 Romanians in the UK: 80,000 working in agriculture, 6,000 working as doctors or nurses and 5,000 as students. Most of the others are in construction or jobs requiring a high degree of education. A tiny, negligible number are without work.</p> <p>Could we not, Campeanu implored, recall how the Romanian construction workers helped to build the Olympic stadium, a ""special achievement""? Could we not see the benefits of the Romanians who had come to the UK? Why would we want to continue to make it difficult for highly intelligent young men and women to make homes there, she wondered? ""I don't think it is normal that some restrictions are addressed only to Romanians and Bulgarians as long as we believe we are equal citizens in the EU,"" she said. ""They must be against everyone, or no one.""</p> <p>There is trouble brewing in Revolutionary Square. Romania and Bulgaria burst into the political debate last week. Campeanu believes that it may be simply a chance for some British politicians to grab a few easy votes at a time when Europe bashing is in vogue.</p> <p>It started with Tory MPs calling for the retention of a visa regime imposed in 2005 that restricts Romanians and Bulgarians to highly skilled jobs that cannot be filled by resident workers, or to seasonal agricultural work.</p> <p>It escalated into reports that the UK government was considering producing negative adverts about Britain to put off migrants. Then Mark Harper, the immigration minister, raised the prospect of preventing some Romanian and Bulgarian workers from using the NHS, so that they would not be ""a burden"".</p> <p>But these attacks on Romanian workers could not have come at a worse time, say Romania's politicians.</p> <p>The country's economy is now in its fifth year of decline, according to a former prime minister, Calin Popescu-Tariceanu, who brought the country into the EU. The popularity of the EU has inevitably waned since the country joined the club on 1 January 2007, when there were raucous parties in Revolutionary Square and nearby University Square. The economic crisis has not helped, of course, and if Britons have their gripes about the EU banning bent bananas, then the Romanians are irritated that they can't slaughter the family pig at Christmas and Easter in the traditional throat-slitting way.</p> <p>But it is not the content of the grumbles that matters, but the very fact that they circulate. There is a growing feeling that the major EU states and the European commission are not taking Romania's needs into account. Last week the latest European commission report on Romania's integration into the EU complained about a lack of progress in fighting political corruption, in what was seen by many as a fresh blow to Romania's dignity. Most importantly, the EU has prevented the Romanian government from increasing its relatively small public debt to invest in infrastructure to try to reduce the gap between their country and the western giants. All this blocking and snubbing, Tariceanu says, is dangerous. ""An economic crisis can have a very important social impact and then of course come the political tensions and conflicts and all the rest. How long will the patience of the people last?""</p> <p>Talking from one of the echoing rooms of the Palace of the Parliament, built to be the former dictator's palace, Tariceanu adds that Britain's attitude will inevitably only add to the frustrations of many Romanians <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> including himself. ""I am living with a certain disappointment,"" he said. ""Why? Because I am looking at Great Britain as a country that is a reference for the democratic and liberal spirit.</p> <p>""I know that the European project has been built around four crucial liberties: the freedom of movement of goods, services, people and capital. I am pretty sure the UK is very much supporting the free circulation of capital, which is not only in its own advantage but everyone's.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-image-403444502""> <img src=""https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/2/2/1359847979159/Key-waves-of-UK-immigrati-001.jpg"" alt=""Key waves of UK immigration"" width=""460"" height=""339"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Key waves of UK immigration. Credit: Observer graphics</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>""But they have to reconsider their position because the free circulation of people is essential for the welfare of Britain. What is making me angry is that it is a planned government campaign against the immigrants. I was not expecting it from a country with such long traditions of democracy and freedom."" The <em>Observer</em> has learned that such is the anger within the Romanian government at the recent rhetoric that the foreign minister, Titus Corlatean, sought and received assurances last week from his counterpart, William Hague, that the UK would live up to its treaty obligations. The UK ambassador to Romania was also, in a most diplomatic way, asked about his government's position by Cristian David, the minister for Romanians abroad, who asked for facts, figures and rational balanced discourse to rule the day on the subject. David said: ""We need to communicate with our people in a balanced and rational way. If we leave an open space for media to interpret figures, it can allow another perception which can be very difficult to erase.""</p> <p>Former Romanian president Ion Iliescu, the first democratic leader after Ceausescu, told the <em>Observer</em>: ""I am waiting for better understanding from Britain for the problems faced by Romania and Romanians."" But the concerns and disappointment of the political classes is merely a reflection of the feelings on the streets outside their offices.</p> <p>Revolutionary Square today bears little resemblance to the scene on the sunny December day in 1989 when the crowds, to the old dictator's obvious surprise, turned on him, causing his flight, capture and execution just four days later on Christmas Day. Much of the square is now a car park for those who work in the ministries of labour, interior and sanitation, among others, that are now housed within the former Communist Central Committee building.</p> <p>On one of the buildings marking out the north side of the square, a banner advert for a bank bears the face of former tennis star Ilie Nastase. On the south side is a shop selling Swiss watches so expensive that the prices aren't advertised. Shuffling across the icy square itself, by a monument for those killed by the old regime, are a few disgruntled workers and students voicing, perhaps not anger at this stage, but disappointment and bitterness.</p> <p>""Things are worse than ever in the EU. Nothing has changed for the better,"" said Sorin Sonie, 38. ""I don't want to leave because I love my country, but I do think it is very unfair for the UK to try and stop people if they want to go and live there. Why us?""</p> <p>Parking attendant Julien Pirvulescu, 56, said: ""I think it is more about politics. I don't want to go and my three children in their 20s don't want to go. People here aren't interested in rushing off there. But it is unfair. It often is.""</p> <p>Vlad Niculesci, 45, who runs an English bookshop on the west side of the square, added: ""There is growing anger because it is discriminatory across the board. The artist Dan Perjovschi, one of the best in Romania, has just done a drawing which is simply a picture of the union flag with all its crosses next to one big, black cross under which is written: for Romanians and Bulgarians. That sums it up.""</p> <p>Perjovschi, exhibiting in Helsinki, explained: ""It is always an irritation when you are questioned as a nation. And when media step in, anger increases or may go out of control. Facebook is full of mockeries of Brits and some superficial 'patriotic' feelings.</p> <p>""On the other hands, Romanians love the Premiership, Robbie Williams and Helen Mirren, and the visual artists are obsessed with Tate Modern. Romanians had a great respect of UK because legend says that Tony Blair contributed massively to our EU bid. Therefore the actual situation is seen as a betrayal.""</p> <p>The inherent danger in this growing feeling of iniquity provoked the Romanian ambassador to the UK, Dr Ion Jinga, speaking from London, to warn of the risks in politicians and some parts of the media ""playing a game"" with the Romanian people. He told the <em>Observer</em>: ""Sometimes tabloids, and unfortunately some politicians, try to involve this topic of immigration from Romania and Bulgaria in a political game and gamble.</p> <p>""But those Romanians who wanted to work abroad have already done it. Seven years ago our population was 22&#xa0;million inhabitants. Last year the census showed we have only 19&#xa0;million because 3&#xa0;million were already abroad. With a country of 22&#xa0;million inhabitants there are only 5&#xa0;million people of an economically active age in Romania, so we experience shortages and have organised job fairs in Spain and Italy to try and convince Romanians in construction to come back. We have reached the maximum export capacity.</p> <p>""And in 2004, the British economy had an economic boom, which is not the case now. I do not see any real risk of a big wave of Romanians coming over.""</p> <p>Jinga added that it was only a demand for Romanian workers that would lead them to travel across Europe to a country whose language many were not well versed in and whose culture was so alien.

Mariana Campeanu, Romanian minister for labour, was in no mood to mince her words last week. Once again, as in 2007 when her country joined the EU, her country's workers are at the centre of a debate in Britain about the threat of benefit-seeking immigrants, fuelled by comments and briefings by government ministers keen for an easy headline, and apocalyptic statistics from Migration Watch about what will happen in 2014 when restrictions on working are lifted for Bulgarians and Romanians. Seated in her large tatty Bucharest office, in what was once the Communist Central Committee Building where Nicolae Ceausescu made his fateful speech in 1989 from a balcony looking over what would become known as Revolutionary Square, Campeanu reeled off a list of statistics and appeals to common sense: Britain is behind Italy, Spain, France, Portugal and Germany as targets for her people. Those who wanted to live abroad now do so, with a million Romanians each in Italy and Spain. There are at most about 150,000 Romanians in the UK: 80,000 working in agriculture, 6,000 working as doctors or nurses and 5,000 as students. Most of the others are in construction or jobs requiring a high degree of education. A tiny, negligible number are without work. Could we not, Campeanu implored, recall how the Romanian construction workers helped to build the Olympic stadium, a ""special achievement""? Could we not see the benefits of the Romanians who had come to the UK? Why would we want to continue to make it difficult for highly intelligent young men and women to make homes there, she wondered? ""I don't think it is normal that some restrictions are addressed only to Romanians and Bulgarians as long as we believe we are equal citizens in the EU,"" she said. ""They must be against everyone, or no one."" There is trouble brewing in Revolutionary Square. Romania and Bulgaria burst into the political debate last week. Campeanu believes that it may be simply a chance for some British politicians to grab a few easy votes at a time when Europe bashing is in vogue. It started with Tory MPs calling for the retention of a visa regime imposed in 2005 that restricts Romanians and Bulgarians to highly skilled jobs that cannot be filled by resident workers, or to seasonal agricultural work. It escalated into reports that the UK government was considering producing negative adverts about Britain to put off migrants. Then Mark Harper, the immigration minister, raised the prospect of preventing some Romanian and Bulgarian workers from using the NHS, so that they would not be ""a burden"". But these attacks on Romanian workers could not have come at a worse time, say Romania's politicians. The country's economy is now in its fifth year of decline, according to a former prime minister, Calin Popescu-Tariceanu, who brought the country into the EU. The popularity of the EU has inevitably waned since the country joined the club on 1 January 2007, when there were raucous parties in Revolutionary Square and nearby University Square. The economic crisis has not helped, of course, and if Britons have their gripes about the EU banning bent bananas, then the Romanians are irritated that they can't slaughter the family pig at Christmas and Easter in the traditional throat-slitting way. But it is not the content of the grumbles that matters, but the very fact that they circulate. There is a growing feeling that the major EU states and the European commission are not taking Romania's needs into account. Last week the latest European commission report on Romania's integration into the EU complained about a lack of progress in fighting political corruption, in what was seen by many as a fresh blow to Romania's dignity. Most importantly, the EU has prevented the Romanian government from increasing its relatively small public debt to invest in infrastructure to try to reduce the gap between their country and the western giants. All this blocking and snubbing, Tariceanu says, is dangerous. ""An economic crisis can have a very important social impact and then of course come the political tensions and conflicts and all the rest. How long will the patience of the people last?"" Talking from one of the echoing rooms of the Palace of the Parliament, built to be the former dictator's palace, Tariceanu adds that Britain's attitude will inevitably only add to the frustrations of many Romanians  including himself. ""I am living with a certain disappointment,"" he said. ""Why? Because I am looking at Great Britain as a country that is a reference for the democratic and liberal spirit. ""I know that the European project has been built around four crucial liberties: the freedom of movement of goods, services, people and capital. I am pretty sure the UK is very much supporting the free circulation of capital, which is not only in its own advantage but everyone's. ""But they have to reconsider their position because the free circulation of people is essential for the welfare of Britain. What is making me angry is that it is a planned government campaign against the immigrants. I was not expecting it from a country with such long traditions of democracy and freedom."" The Observer has learned that such is the anger within the Romanian government at the recent rhetoric that the foreign minister, Titus Corlatean, sought and received assurances last week from his counterpart, William Hague, that the UK would live up to its treaty obligations. The UK ambassador to Romania was also, in a most diplomatic way, asked about his government's position by Cristian David, the minister for Romanians abroad, who asked for facts, figures and rational balanced discourse to rule the day on the subject. David said: ""We need to communicate with our people in a balanced and rational way. If we leave an open space for media to interpret figures, it can allow another perception which can be very difficult to erase."" Former Romanian president Ion Iliescu, the first democratic leader after Ceausescu, told the Observer: ""I am waiting for better understanding from Britain for the problems faced by Romania and Romanians."" But the concerns and disappointment of the political classes is merely a reflection of the feelings on the streets outside their offices. Revolutionary Square today bears little resemblance to the scene on the sunny December day in 1989 when the crowds, to the old dictator's obvious surprise, turned on him, causing his flight, capture and execution just four days later on Christmas Day. Much of the square is now a car park for those who work in the ministries of labour, interior and sanitation, among others, that are now housed within the former Communist Central Committee building. On one of the buildings marking out the north side of the square, a banner advert for a bank bears the face of former tennis star Ilie Nastase. On the south side is a shop selling Swiss watches so expensive that the prices aren't advertised. Shuffling across the icy square itself, by a monument for those killed by the old regime, are a few disgruntled workers and students voicing, perhaps not anger at this stage, but disappointment and bitterness. ""Things are worse than ever in the EU. Nothing has changed for the better,"" said Sorin Sonie, 38. ""I don't want to leave because I love my country, but I do think it is very unfair for the UK to try and stop people if they want to go and live there. Why us?"" Parking attendant Julien Pirvulescu, 56, said: ""I think it is more about politics. I don't want to go and my three children in their 20s don't want to go. People here aren't interested in rushing off there. But it is unfair. It often is."" Vlad Niculesci, 45, who runs an English bookshop on the west side of the square, added: ""There is growing anger because it is discriminatory across the board. The artist Dan Perjovschi, one of the best in Romania, has just done a drawing which is simply a picture of the union flag with all its crosses next to one big, black cross under which is written: for Romanians and Bulgarians. That sums it up."" Perjovschi, exhibiting in Helsinki, explained: ""It is always an irritation when you are questioned as a nation. And when media step in, anger increases or may go out of control. Facebook is full of mockeries of Brits and some superficial 'patriotic' feelings. ""On the other hands, Romanians love the Premiership, Robbie Williams and Helen Mirren, and the visual artists are obsessed with Tate Modern. Romanians had a great respect of UK because legend says that Tony Blair contributed massively to our EU bid. Therefore the actual situation is seen as a betrayal."" The inherent danger in this growing feeling of iniquity provoked the Romanian ambassador to the UK, Dr Ion Jinga, speaking from London, to warn of the risks in politicians and some parts of the media ""playing a game"" with the Romanian people. He told the Observer: ""Sometimes tabloids, and unfortunately some politicians, try to involve this topic of immigration from Romania and Bulgaria in a political game and gamble. ""But those Romanians who wanted to work abroad have already done it. Seven years ago our population was 22million inhabitants. Last year the census showed we have only 19million because 3million were already abroad. With a country of 22million inhabitants there are only 5million people of an economically active age in Romania, so we experience shortages and have organised job fairs in Spain and Italy to try and convince Romanians in construction to come back. We have reached the maximum export capacity. ""And in 2004, the British economy had an economic boom, which is not the case now. I do not see any real risk of a big wave of Romanians coming over."" Jinga added that it was only a demand for Romanian workers that would lead them to travel across Europe to a country whose language many were not well versed in and whose culture was so alien. He said: ""The Olympic village of the last Olympic Games was built by Romanian builders, even if the construction sector was closed to Romanians. Not because they came to take British jobs but because there were not enough British builders to work and they were asked to come and they became self-employed."" Jinga said he sees the rhetoric around the immigration of Bulgarians and Romanians as pure electioneering. And he is withering about the reported plan to wage a negative advertising campaign to put Romanians off, said by sources to have now been ditched under diplomatic pressure. Jinga said: ""My interpretation is that it is very connected to a political situation: some anti-European speeches and some positioning before the election so that every possible risk is closed. But there is no risk to Britain. ""It is up to the British government to decide on what sort of campaign you want to promote for your country. If you ask me as a person who spent the last five years here and is very honestly in love with this country, I would not do it. In Romania we would never do a negative campaign about Romania saying to foreigners, 'Don't come, it's rubbish.' If you want to do it, it is up to you. It would be a pity."" Either way, it would seem that the British government now has its work cut out to make things right with the people in and around Revolutionary Square."

From New Year's Day all jobseekers from the EU will have to wait for three months from their arrival in the UK before they can apply to claim any out of work benefits, Downing Street announced. The scrambled clampdown betrays the extreme nervousness in Downing Street at the possible reaction of potential Tory voters  and increasingly restive Tory backbenchers  if the public decide ministers have failed to take every measure possible to prevent Romanians and Bulgarians travelling to Britain en masse. David Cameron said he believed the restrictions would ""make the UK a less attractive place for EU migrants who want to come here and try to live off the state"". The prime minister added that he wanted to ""send the clear message that whilst Britain is very much open for business, we will not welcome people who don't want to contribute"".

The work and pensions secretary, Iain Duncan Smith, has also changed rules so benefits will only be available to claimants who speak reasonable English.

The prime minister is determined to further tighten the restrictions imposed on Bulgarians and Romanians before the current transitional controls are lifted in January. A total of 35 Tory backbenchers, mainly on the right of the party, have also tabled an amendment to the immigration bill in the Commons so that the transitional controls on Romania and Bulgaria remain in force until 2019, five years longer than allowed under EU law. The move, led by Nigel Mills, MP for Amber Valley in Derbyshire, is likely to gain Tory backbench support. Mills claims up to 50,000 Romanians and Bulgarians a year will travel to the UK once curbs on the types of jobs they can take are lifted. Cameron is aware that if he acts unilaterally by restricting access to employment benefits, he is likely to be challenged in the courts, but this could take many years and in the meantime his position in the opinion polls may be bolstered. It is possible he will make an announcement as early as this week but Downing Street was suggesting it was unlikely that Cameron would propose Romanians and Bulgarians be denied jobseeker's allowance until they had been resident in the UK for up to 12 months, instead of the current minimum of three months. But they admitted Cameron was looking at extending the qualifying period, as well as restricting access to child benefit. It is not clear if the new curbs would be imposed on all EU migrants or just Romanians and Bulgarians. The coalition government has been in a long row with the EU over its habitual residence test  the additional UK test applied before EU migrants can receive benefits. Alistair Carmichael, the Liberal Democrat Scottish secretary, hinted at Liberal Democrat resistance to a clampdown on benefits rights, saying the plans were still under consideration in government and any approach should be discussed in Europe. He told BBC Radio 5's Pienaar's Politics show he could ""see the need for robust transitional arrangements"" but added: ""I would need to be persuaded of that but I am prepared to look at the whole situation in the round."" He warned: ""Potentially it might put us on the wrong side of the rest of the European Union. As a member state I don't want to find myself in that territory. It's something that we should be discussing with them, certainly."" Eight countries  including the UK, France and Germany  imposed restrictions on Bulgarian and Romanian workers, all due to expire at the end of 2013. Both the Daily Mail and the Times published opinion polls last week showing overwhelming negativity towards further immigration from the two countries. Cameron will be wary of acting unilaterally without EU diplomatic support. There is growing EU backing for measures to limit the free movement of workers within member states, a measure introduced when the EU was far smaller and culturally more homogenous than now. Some of his allies are arguing that he should stick to building those alliances rather than acting unilaterally. But Cameron is also aware that Ukip's selling point in next year's European elections is its offer to quit the EU and so regain control of Britain's borders. Theresa May, the home secretary, has also published an immigration bill to restrict access to housing and health benefits. On the Andrew Marr Show on BBC1, Gove backed the restrictions: ""I absolutely agree with [Cameron] and I do think it's practical politics. The prime minister has struck exactly the right note on migration, which is to celebrate the achievements of people who have come here, to recognise that migration has to work for those who are already here."" He added: ""When it comes to new migrants from accession countries in the EU, we need to look properly at the benefits system here to make sure people are coming here to work and contribute, not to take advantage of what is rightly a generous welfare system."" The shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, acknowledged that the ""pace of immigration was too fast, the level of immigration was too high"" under the Labour government. She told the Andrew Marr Show: We already said last year there were changes the government could make already within the existing rules and changes that they should argue for across Europe as well to make sure the system is fairer.

The original estimate by University College, London, which calculated that 15,000 Poles and others would arrive each year, was based on an assumption that all the other EU countries would open their borders when former communist states joined in 2004. In the event, only Britain, Ireland and Sweden opened their borders immediately to allow migrants to work. The rest of the EU, including Germany, imposed the seven-year transitional controls, which came to an end only two years ago. Harper said there were also other countries which already had significant populations of Romanians and Bulgarians, including Italy and Spain. The eight countries, besides the UK, due to open their borders to Romanian and Bulgarian labour migrants are Austria, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands and France. More than three million Romanians went to work abroad when Romania joined the EU in 2007; the majority went toItaly and Spain, which have already opened their labour markets to them.

He said Britain's domestic courts would rule that an extension of controls would not comply with the treaties. Harper's assessment came as the chief inspector of borders and immigration, John Vine, published a critical report showing that only one in four smugglers caught by Border Force officers are being fined or prosecuted. Vine also criticises the searching priorities of the Border Force and HM Revenues and Customs by highlighting that 68% of freight consignments targeted for checks at the border are actually undergoing a physical examination while 43,000 low-risk cargoes were being checked. The report on the state of customs and border checks on the 311m tonnes of freight coming into Britain each also confirms previous warnings that immigration staff have been switched from looking for drugs and smuggled tobacco to carry out 100% passport checks on passengers. Vine's report says that only 2,971 out of 11,839 seizures of smuggled goods made by Border Force officials  one in four  were being referred to HMRC for financial penalty or possible prosecution because of a breakdown of communication: ""I also found that large quantities of cigarettes and alcohol were not being investigated or prosecuted,"" said Vine. Harper responded by saying that work was already underway to ensure that more cases were referred to prosecution but added that there had been a shift in focus to prosecuting cases where larger quantities were involved and there was a reasonable chance of prosecution."

Fuelled by projections that as many as 250,000 might arrive by 2019, and by ministers equivocating on whether it they have received estimates or not, there are now belated moves to review the free movement rules.</p> <p>This could almost be an object lesson in how not to prepare for a new wave of migrants, and of failing to learn from the first EU expansion in 2004. It all presupposes that there will be a wave of immigration, and that if there is that it will put pressure on housing and other public services. Is this actually likely to happen?</p> <p>The controversy first broke when communities secretary Eric Pickles was interviewed in January, hinting that <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2261705/Government-figure-people-come-UK-Bulgaria-Romania-wont-tell-rest-us.html"" title="""">government estimates</a> over the number of migrants to expect from these countries did exist.

But this comparison is highly questionable.</p> <p>Only Britain, Ireland and Sweden allowed entry to new EU nationals in 2004, so the pent-up desire to move countries was strongly focused on the UK, to which Poland in particular had historic ties.

Fuelled by projections that as many as 250,000 might arrive by 2019, and by ministers equivocating on whether it they have received estimates or not, there are now belated moves to review the free movement rules. This could almost be an object lesson in how not to prepare for a new wave of migrants, and of failing to learn from the first EU expansion in 2004. It all presupposes that there will be a wave of immigration, and that if there is that it will put pressure on housing and other public services. Is this actually likely to happen? The controversy first broke when communities secretary Eric Pickles was interviewed in January, hinting that government estimates over the number of migrants to expect from these countries did exist. Presumably this triggered the release of new forecasts from Migration Watch a few days later, predicting additional immigration of 50,000 people per year, based on the events of 2004. But this comparison is highly questionable. Only Britain, Ireland and Sweden allowed entry to new EU nationals in 2004, so the pent-up desire to move countries was strongly focused on the UK, to which Poland in particular had historic ties. A more appropriate comparison, suggested by Sue Lukes of MigrationWork, is with what happened when Germany finally dropped its restrictions in May 2011: immigration barely increased because most of the people who wanted to move had already done so, and the economic situation was by then very different to that in 2004. Second, Bulgarians and Romanians have had freedom to move to several countries since 2007: three million have already migrated to Italy, Spain and elsewhere. From 2014 they can go anywhere in Europe. Even though UK restrictions were partially lifted six years ago, only around 100,000 have moved here since. Why would Britain suddenly become more popular, especially when most established Bulgarians and Romanians live in London where it is now extremely difficult to find somewhere to live? Bearing in mind the Migration Observatory's warning that there is no sound method for calculating a reliable figure, the suggestion by the Romanian ambassador that the yearly total might be nearer 10,000 than 50,000 seems a far more likely guess. But even if the figures are lower than the scare stories suggest, will the newcomers affect housing demand? Obviously, the simple answer is yes, because any arrivals are bound to look for accommodation. But given that skilled or self-employed nationals from these countries can already work in Britain, any new attraction is likely to be to low-paid workers.

Altering the entitlements of EU nationals to wider benefits is fraught with problems because it depends on the interpretation of both UK and EU law.

Other prominent politicians, including Theresa May and Ed Miliband, have raised concerns that increased migration may reduce wages, especially for the lowest earners.</p> <p>While <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/12/theresa-may-immigration-speech"" title="""">no clear evidence</a> supports assertions that immigration reduces average earnings, available research suggests immigration may place modest downward pressure on wages for the lowest paid. Two prominent studies find modest effects, in one case estimating that each 1% increase in the share of migrants in the UK working age population leads to a 0.6% decline in the wages of the 5% lowest paid workers, which would mean about 3p less per hour for someone earning just over the minimum wage of <c3><83><e2><80><9a><c3><82><c2><a3>6.19.</p> <p>These large-scale studies may disguise bigger effects on particular sectors. Construction, for example, is the biggest single sector for Romanian workers in the UK. An increase in A2 migration may mean some of the biggest wage impacts are felt by recent migrants from Poland who are also concentrated in construction jobs.</p> <p>The end of labour market restrictions also means Romanian and Bulgarian workers tied to the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme (SAWS) will no longer have to stay in that sector. In theory, this might create a labour shortage that could lead to wages in that sector increasing as farmers try to attract other workers, unless other steps are taken to maintain the supply of low-wage workers.</p> <p>But the size of any effects <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> whether on wages, housing or anything else <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> will depend on the scale of net migration from Romania and Bulgaria. This degree of change, of course, is currently the source of much speculation and hyperbole. In October last year the Daily Express ran the headline: ""<a href=""http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/355041/Now-29m-Bulgarians-and-Romanians-can-soon-move-to-Britain"" title="""">Now 29m Bulgarians and Romanians can soon move to Britain</a>"" Other papers went down down a similar route.</p> <p>The headline is technically correct but misleading. The entire populations of these two countries will not move to the UK, any more than 80 million Germans or 65 million French people will. The narrative seems to have been framed by the startling impact of the accession of Poland and the rest of the A8 countries in 2004 <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> which saw a tenfold increase of the Polish population in the UK to more than half a million. But the parallel between 2004 and 2014 misses some important differences in the situations.</p> <p>First, Romanians and Bulgarians have had open access to the UK, if not its labour markets, for six years already, so many of those who would be interested in travelling to and living in the UK have already come. In 2004, borders and labour markets were opened at the same time.</p> <p>Second, in 2004 only three EU nations <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> the UK, the Republic of Ireland and Sweden <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> opened their labour markets to A8 workers without restrictions.

Many are wondering what the effects will be  although some impacts of Romanian and Bulgarian free movement have already happened, with an estimated 100,000 to 150,000 people born in the A2 currently living in Britain. Still, the lifting of restrictions creates an expectation of increasing rates of immigration. Over the weekend Eric Pickles claimed to have seen estimates of how many Romanians and Bulgarians might arrive  though he would not reveal what the estimates were  and worried about pressure on the UK's housing market. Other prominent politicians, including Theresa May and Ed Miliband, have raised concerns that increased migration may reduce wages, especially for the lowest earners. While no clear evidence supports assertions that immigration reduces average earnings, available research suggests immigration may place modest downward pressure on wages for the lowest paid. Two prominent studies find modest effects, in one case estimating that each 1% increase in the share of migrants in the UK working age population leads to a 0.6% decline in the wages of the 5% lowest paid workers, which would mean about 3p less per hour for someone earning just over the minimum wage of 6.19. These large-scale studies may disguise bigger effects on particular sectors. Construction, for example, is the biggest single sector for Romanian workers in the UK. An increase in A2 migration may mean some of the biggest wage impacts are felt by recent migrants from Poland who are also concentrated in construction jobs. The end of labour market restrictions also means Romanian and Bulgarian workers tied to the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme (SAWS) will no longer have to stay in that sector. In theory, this might create a labour shortage that could lead to wages in that sector increasing as farmers try to attract other workers, unless other steps are taken to maintain the supply of low-wage workers. But the size of any effects  whether on wages, housing or anything else  will depend on the scale of net migration from Romania and Bulgaria. This degree of change, of course, is currently the source of much speculation and hyperbole. In October last year the Daily Express ran the headline: ""Now 29m Bulgarians and Romanians can soon move to Britain"" Other papers went down down a similar route. The headline is technically correct but misleading. The entire populations of these two countries will not move to the UK, any more than 80 million Germans or 65 million French people will. The narrative seems to have been framed by the startling impact of the accession of Poland and the rest of the A8 countries in 2004  which saw a tenfold increase of the Polish population in the UK to more than half a million. But the parallel between 2004 and 2014 misses some important differences in the situations. First, Romanians and Bulgarians have had open access to the UK, if not its labour markets, for six years already, so many of those who would be interested in travelling to and living in the UK have already come. In 2004, borders and labour markets were opened at the same time. Second, in 2004 only three EU nations  the UK, the Republic of Ireland and Sweden  opened their labour markets to A8 workers without restrictions. This made Britain, with its large economy and flexible labour market, a leading destination. In 2014 the entire EU will be obliged to open labour markets to Romanian and Bulgarian workers, so countries like Germany and France may prove very attractive too. Third, the combined populations of Romania and Bulgaria is around 29 million, whereas the combined populations of the A8 countries is around 70 million, meaning there is considerably less potential supply. However, the A2 are poorer countries than the A8 average, which could mitigate this difference. Finally, Romanian and Bulgarians who have emigrated to the EU up to this point have not been especially likely to choose the UK. The majority of Romanian-born emigrants in Europe are concentrated in just two countries: Spain and Italy. Established personal and economic networks are a ""pull factor"" that may continue to lead A2 migrants to Spain, Italy, and elsewhere. It is understandable that the British public wants to know what is going to happen when Romania and Bulgaria become full EU members  whether wages will be affected, or housing queues pushed up, but the truth is complicated and unclear. Models and theories are not crystal balls and don't show the future, they are simply ways of looking at what might happen in certain circumstances. The estimates were wrong in 2004, there's little reason to think they will be right this time."

One Lib Dem said: ""The issue of Romanians and Bulgarians is a red herring. There is EU law. Anything you do would have to apply to all EU member states. ""We are up for making sure that the rules are correct. But they should not just apply to Romanians and Bulgarians. We have to look at the rules for all EU migrants."" Downing Street indicated on Friday that it was minded to impose limits when the prime minister's spokeswoman said that Britain would only welcome the ""brightest and the best"". The spokeswoman said: ""What we are, and have been, very clear about is we welcome the brightest and best to the UK and support immigration that helps the UK labour market and our economy. What we don't welcome is the problem of the abuse of free movement when it comes to the pressures it can put on the UK. We welcome the free movement if it benefits our economy.

Campaign groups such as MigrationWatch have rushed to predict that 250,000 will come over the next five years. One Tory rightwinger, Philip Hollobone, has claimed that Britain's countryside will have to be built over to make room for a trebling in the size of the Romanian and Bulgarian communities to 425,000 within two years. But even he can't match the warning from the Ukip MEP Godfrey Bloom, who claims 1.5 million from the two countries will come looking for work. This from a party that makes no bones about its willingness to put fears over mass immigration at the heart of its campaigning over the next year. All these ""predictions"" are based on the criticism that far more Poles and other eastern Europeans came after 2004 than was foreseen by the official estimates. But MigrationWatch and co are themselves now in danger of making a similar mistake. The original estimate that only 13,000 Poles, Czechs and others would come each year after they joined the European Union was based on projections from what happened when Spain and Greece joined the EU in the 1980s. The study also assumed that every EU country would open their borders to workers from Poland and other new member states. In the event only the UK, Sweden and Ireland were prepared to do that, with the now well-known result. One of the authors of the study, Professor Christian Dustmann, has said that he is ""absolutely sure"" that if Germany had opened its labour market to the Poles and others, the numbers coming to Britain would have been much lower. Well, this time it will be different. All the other 25 EU states will have to lift their labour market restrictions on Romanian and Bulgarian migrants from 1 January 2014 as the seven-year transition period since the two countries joined runs out. This time Germany, a lot closer, will be opening its borders. But there is another important difference between Romania and Bulgaria and the eastern European countries that joined in 2004. More than 1.7 million of the 2.2 million Romanians who live in another EU state live in Italy and Spain. At the last count 82,000 Romanians were resident in Britain. Italy, where 880,000 Romanians already work, scrapped its remaining labour restrictions on Romanians and Bulgarians in January last year. In Spain, where a further 820,000 have been working in the struggling construction industry, the situation is more complicated. In the face of unemployment hitting 21%, the Spanish re-imposed work restrictions on Romanians and Bulgarians a year ago. This has led MigrationWatch and others to predict that there is now a ""significant risk"" that hundreds of thousands will move from Spain to Britain. But as the home secretary's migration advisory committee has pointed out, this is only a real possibility if Britain is the only country to open its labour market to the Romanians now in Spain.

Backed by the National Farmers Union, which represents the fruitpicking industry in Worcestershire and Herefordshire, they have been pressing the home secretary to keep open the seasonal agricultural workers' scheme under which 20,000 Romanians and Bulgarians have been coming to work in Britain for several months each year  before going back home again. The Romanians and Bulgarians who come next year are not expected to help out with the British strawberry crop. It is thought they will head for better-paid and higher-skilled jobs in London and other cities when they will be able to take a permanent job as well as living in Britain.

So MigrationWatch's prediction of 50,000 a year over the next five years actually starts looking like a potential fall in numbers. It is not likely that fewer Romanians and Bulgarians will end up here but it is a possibility and one that is as worthy of consideration as all the ""invasion"" predictions that have more in common with astrology than demography."

The drive has been given an added urgency by the Ukip surge in the Eastleigh byelection. Labour's Frank Field, one of the MPs pressing for a crackdown, claimed Eastleigh had produced a change of heart, but ministers argue there is still a thicket of EU regulations on free movement of workers that they have been studying since the autumn. A large cabinet subcommittee on migrants' access to benefits, chaired by the immigration minister, Mark Harper, has met six times to look at options ranging across access to housing, welfare and health services and the possibility of introducing a form of entitlement card for all EU citizens. Ministers are tussling with the impact of a series of judgments at the European court of justice defending the free movement of workers within the EU, so making any hasty move will be difficult. They have been looking at a huge range of possibilities department by department, but the prime minister's spokesman stressed that the government was still at the stage of examining options. Kenneth Clarke, the former justice secretary, urged his party not to lurch to the right following the Eastleigh result last week, saying it would be folly to try to match Ukip: ""If you imitate Ukip you make then more prominent and then you drive more moderate people to stick with the Liberal Democrats.

Apart from the political urgency caused by Ukip's success, Britain needs to make a decision before controls on Romanians and Bulgarians are lifted at the end of the year. The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, is looking at restricting access to health services via a tighter habitual residency test. Hunt has been looking at whether non-EU nationals would be required to carry health insurance, although in practice the NHS can charge overseas visitors not normally resident in the UK. Moreover, UK nationals can apply for a European health insurance card to get state healthcare at a reduced cost within the EU. The Home Office is looking to see if it would be legal to charge EU citizens who live in the UK for three months or more to purchase an entitlement card or ID card. Possession of the card would act as proof to jobcentre staff, GPs and housing officers that the owner is entitled to UK benefits. Harper is already introducing an ID regime to test whether, for example, foreign students ""are really here for that purpose [study] and not coming here just to claim benefits"". Britain could extend that to all EU nationals, a move already being pioneered in the Netherlands. Philip Hollobone, the Conservative MP for Kettering, who claimed the Spanish already ""interpret the free movement directive much more robustly"". Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary, is examining whether someone could only be deemed ""habitually resident"", and so entitled to social security benefits, if they have been in the UK for a year, instead of the current three months. Duncan Smith is also seeking EU allies to fend off European commission legal proceedings claiming that Britain has introduced an additional right to reside test that indirectly discriminates against EU citizens. The EU ruled in 2011 that the right to reside test is discriminatory since EU nationals have their cases heard on a case by case basis while UK nationals only have to prove they are UK citizens. The commission argues that the EU-wide ""habitual residence"" rules are a sufficient safeguard against ""benefit tourism"". Duncan Smith said he was still seeking allies in Europe to defeat the commission, describing the dispute as a big battle. The justice secretary, Chris Grayling, is also looking at reducing access to legal aid for migrants, although in practice cuts to the legal aid budget have already reduced access. Cameron last week told the Daily Express: ""We can no longer grant legal aid to non-UK nationals or for civil cases, people who are facing housing cases or benefit cases.""

Some councils, such as Westminster, require a 10-year proven local connection for a resident to be given extra points on the housing waiting list, but in reality many access social housing through homelessness routes, or through their children, so making the local connection route less relevant. EU citizens cannot be discriminated against. Field claimed the threat of mass migration from Romania and Bulgaria gave the government the opportunity to change the nature of the welfare state. ""Similarly it's a chance for Labour to decide about whether or not they want to see a welfare state which is based on contributions that can be built up by their own efforts, by their own residency, or whether in fact you continue as we have in the past since 1979 of just giving welfare out if you can prove need."""
