And yet one of the oft-asked questions when it comes to this tree in the garden is why doesnt my holly have any berries? The plant family Ilex - of which the European holly Ilex aquifolium is a member - consists mostly of dioecious plants, meaning there are distinct male and female specimens, and only the female bears berries - and thats provided theres a male plant in the vicinity.  There are exceptions: I. aquifolium Pyramidalis and JC van Tol are both self-fertile, so they dont need another plant for cross pollination and can produce berries all on their own. Their leaves are also much less spiny than regular I. aquifolium, which may or may not appeal. For more information on the vast range of hollies for gardens, check out this feature by Naomi Slade from the Guardian archive .

In New Zealand, a tree that features on many a Christmas card is Metrosideros excelsa, a member of the myrtle family known to Maori people as pohutukawa. Settlers, noting its habit of producing beautiful red bottlebrush flowers around Christmas time, dubbed it the New Zealand Christmas tree. Its too tender to grow outside in the UK unless you happen to live in the Isles of Scilly. In San Francisco, on the other hand, it grows rather too well. Australia has the New South Wales Christmas bush, Ceratopetalum gummiferum: it too turns red in December, although the colour is the result of the sepals of the seed capsules, not the preceding flowers, which are white.

The plans to kill two-thirds of the countrys wolves caused outrage among conservationists at home and abroad when they were announced by local predator management boards in September, with warnings the cull would be disastrous for the species. But on Tuesday Vidar Helgesen, minister of climate and the environment, refused to sanction the cull, saying lawyers at the justice ministry had concluded it would contravene domestic biodiversity legislation and the international Bern convention.  The laws state that culling of endangered predators  there are an estimated 68 wolves in Norway  can only be granted if there is a satisfactorily documented risk of damage to livestock. This proved not to have been the case with 32 wolves from four packs in the county of Hedmark.   Related: Norway plans to cull more than two-thirds of its wolf population  The other 15 animals which will still be hunted are young lone wolves which range over greater distances and are more prone to killing livestock, and environmental groups have not objected to these being culled.  This is a great day and the best Christmas present you could wish for, said Nina Jensen of WWF Norway. At last the government has shown that Norwegian wolves also have protection in law. It is a protected species that is critically endangered and has a natural place in Norwegian fauna. Todays pardon for the 32 wolves caused surprise among both the conservation and hunting lobbies, as the government had been expected to support the cull. More than 300 hunters who were cooperating with the police and the county governor to prepare for the hunt, due to start on 2 January, now have to put away their guns. This was a surprising decision based on odd reasoning, said Arnfinn Nergrd, director of the predator management board in Hedmark county. The framework for predator management has been set by parliament, with local predator management boards setting hunting and culling quotas when population targets have been achieved. The final decision for a cull, however, is given by the government. The rejection of sanctioned culls, coupled with continuing rural community concerns over wolves, has raised the prospect of illegal poaching. Nergrd declined to comment on the possibility of poaching, but said the wolf population has recovered considerably after six local poachers were imprisoned in an unprecedented case two years ago. This may suggest that extensive poaching was taking place, he conceded.   Related: Norway's wolf cull pits sheep farmers against conservationists  Environmental groups attribute their victory not only to the wolfs iconic status, but also to more than 70,000 Norwegians who signed a petition protesting against the proposed culling. Helgesen received close to 7,000 emails in both Norwegian and English, and the story made headlines around Europe.  It proves that pressure from environmental groups and public opinion matters, said Silje Ask Lundberg of Friends of the Earth Norway. Predator management in Norway has not always been based on sound knowledge. The Berne convention clearly states that endangered predators can only be culled if the individuals have been proven to cause extensive damage.  That has not been the case with these wolves who over a period of six years have only been documented to kill 10 sheep, and that was due to a hole in a fence."

Internationally its seen as a green role model, what with its pledge to become climate-neutral by 2030, a reliance on hydropower and ambitious plans for electric cars. But at the same time, its one of the worlds largest exporters of oil and gas. Its a paradox that has made a new generation of young Norwegians more environmentally conscious than ever. They are challenging politicians on their decisions over oil exploration  by filing a lawsuit against the government, for instance  and campaigning for a more sustainable future.  Related: Norway pledges to become climate neutral by 2030  Students are also scrutinising Norwegian companies on environmental issues. Theres definitely a push for sustainability in Norway right now, says Lauren Guido, 21, who studies international development and environmental studies at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences. The green movement is on peoples minds. And students are at the heart of it. Young people understand the urgency. We are the ones that will have to inherit the problems, says Arnstein Vestre, 25, a student who works part time at Greenpeace Norway. Nature and Youth, a youth group with around 8,000 members aged 13-25, have filed a lawsuit against the Norwegian government, along with Greenpeace and other independent activists, over a decision to open up the Barents Sea for oil exploration. Oil is the issue thats most difficult to talk about in Norway, says Ingrid Skjoldvr, 23, leader of Nature and Youth. Were seen as the good guy internationally, but were not doing whats necessary at home. So we need to walk the walk. The case centres around a claim that the government has violated part of the Norwegian constitution that says future generations have a right to a healthy environment. Its unique because this clause hasnt been cited before, so its exciting, says Skjoldvr. Norway aspires to be a global leader on climate change and to inspire others to action, adds Vestre. But if we want to do that, we cant have this kind of hypocrisy.  Related: Want to make a difference at university? Join the clubs  Younger school students also have strong views on Norways environmental issues. At my city, my responsibility, a project organised by InterBridge, a social enterprise that aims to empower citizens to participate in global issues, 19 school children were given a platform to make their demands of politicians. After four weekends of workshops and discussions, they presented their ideas in front of them, and the public, at Oslo City Hall. These included making greater use of renewable energies, reducing meat and dairy consumption, and making bicycles more easily available to the public. Amanda Anvar, 14, told politicians she worries about Norways global effect. I want my children to grow up in a city where energy comes from a credible source, and where people on the other side of the world dont have to suffer for us to use it, she says. Norway should focus on renewable energy, rather than our precious dirty gold, meaning our oil, adds Michelle Ann Wurschmidt, 16. Presenting to politicians was an emotional rollercoaster. But I want to show them that young people are capable of more than just using their parents money. As school pupils take the politicians on, Norwegian university students are infiltrating corporations and challenging them to be more sustainable. As part of a project enabled by social enterprise the Innovation Effect, students are conducting research on Orkla, one of the largest companies in Norway, which sells food and home products and employs 30,000 people across more than 40 countries. The team of students has been scrutinising the company to see how it could be more environmentally friendly. Guido says that working inside an organisation, while remaining independent, puts you in a powerful position. A lot of people think of big companies as the bad guys. But working with business can make change happen, she adds. We can be the bridge between them and the public. The team of students presented their findings, which included a need for greater transparency and for more affordable sustainable products, to Orkla at Oslo Innovation Week this month. They spoke to a room full of business leaders  including Orkla  in the hope of inspiring other Norwegian businesses to take note. Everyone says we have to save the world, says Erlend Hjert, 22, who studies at Kristiania University College. And by challenging Norwegian companies, were giving an example of how we can do it.  Related: Why I started an LGBT club at my all-girls school  This new generation of environmentally conscious students is well placed to make a difference. When youre young you have so many ideas and youre not as naive as the big firms believe, says Caroline Strmme, 25, studying at BI Norwegian Business School. Youre not controlled by any firm because youre not employed by them. Guido agrees. We have grit, she says. Because you cant just go to university and get a job now. You have to be creative. But young people need to communicate their values to older generations effectively, they say. A lot of older people say climate change is in the distance, says Anette Gutterd, 22, studying at Kristiania University College. We dont think like that. But we need to say it in a way the older generation understands. Growing up in a country with some of the worlds best environmental policies, as well as an economy based on oil wealth, means young Norwegians have strong opinions on the environment. But even more of this generation need to raise their voices too, says Wurschmidt. Many teenagers believe they dont have a say in the decision-making going on in the world, but of course we have a say in the making of our future. We, the youth, need to claim the voice that is ours.

The case is being brought by an alliance including Greenpeace, indigenous activists, youth groups, and the former director of Nasas Goddard institute for space studies, James Hansen. Norway is seen internationally as a green role model by many for its pledge of climate neutrality by 2030, its reliance on hydropower and ambitious plans for electric cars. But Conservative prime minister, Erna Solberg, could now be forced to appear before an Oslo city court on charges of violating Article 112 of the countrys constitution, which guarantees every citizens right to a healthy, diverse and productive environment. Truls Gulowsen, the director of Greenpeace Norway, said: Signing an international climate agreement while throwing open the door to Arctic oil drilling is a dangerous act of hypocrisy. By allowing oil companies to drill in the Arctic, Norway risks undermining global efforts to address climate change.  The case hinges on licences handed out to 13 oil companies - including Statoil, Chevron and Aker BP - allowing oil exploration in the Barents Sea, the most northerly point yet prospected. Several exploratory wells are planned to open in 2017, and these could help wreck the Paris climate agreements ambition of holding global warming to 1.5C, the plaintiffs say. In a letter to the prime minister seen by the Guardian, Hansen compares Norways behaviour to that of a climate rogue state. I will not mince words, Mrs Solberg, he says. Your governments actions are utterly at odds with the scientific consensus that underpins the Paris agreement. Norway appears hell-bent on sabotaging the treaty before it has even come into effect. Speaking to the Guardian from Oslo, Hansen added: Norway is not all that green. It is burning 70% more fossil fuels per person than Sweden, and mining 20 times more fossil fuels than it needs for its own use. It is using that to create wealth but it is going to have to decide: does it want to be a rogue state or does it want to obey the rule of law? Next month, a ruling is expected in a similar civil rights-style class action that Hansen and his grand-daughter, Sophie, filed against the US government, along with 20 other young people. Shifting the climate fight towards the courts is a new strategy for campaigners, with high-profile legal actions being heard in the Netherlands and the Philippines in the last two years. Several more lawsuits are being prepared around the world, although campaigners will not yet share details. The Norwegian case focuses on a constitutional amendment  Article 112  passed in 2014 that has never been tested in a court of law. This stipulates that every person has a right to an environment that is conducive to health and to a natural environment whose productivity and diversity are maintained. Natural resources should be managed on the basis of comprehensive long-term considerations whereby this right will be safeguarded for future generations as well. Gulowsen said: The constitutional passage is unexplored territory but our lawyers believe we have a very strong case. The factual basis [of the claim] is there. The question is how the court will deal with the facts. Another litigant, Ingrid Skjoldvrfrom the Nature and Youth group, added: We will argue in court that the Norwegian government has an obligation to keep its climate promises and will invoke the peoples right to a healthy environment for ours and future generations. This is the People vs Arctic oil! One firm which is not participating in the new Arctic oil rush is Shell, which pulled out of a drilling project in Alaskas Chukchi Sea last year, privately conceding reputational damage. Publicly, Shell blames low oil prices for its retreat from the Barents this time. Tor Arnesen, the director of A/S Norske Shell, said: Despite knowing we could have explored safely, both environmentally and technically, the current conditions are such that we globally have to prioritise activities with a shorter return on investment."

Im in the depths of Oslomarka, a network of coniferous forests on the edge of Oslo where, every year since 1947, a tree has been felled, to be shipped to London and presented as the Trafalgar Square Christmas tree. There it will stand, decorated in traditional Norwegian style, until 6 January. The Queen of the Forest (as locals call it) is given in gratitude for Britains assistance during the second world war. This years chosen one is 27 metres tall, weighs some 4 tonnes and is 95 years old. Oslo is surrounded by natural beauty; edged with woodland and a fjord, it is often described as the blue, the green and the city in between. It feels truly wild, populated with moose, lynx, roe deer and even the odd wolf. Two wolves live out here now, says Oslo mayor, Marianne Borgen. They are not hunted, they are welcome. Oslo is edged with woodland and a fjord, it is often described as the blue, the green and the city in between.  Locals love the proximity of the countryside. In the winter, you can take your skis, get on the tram and be on the slopes in 20 minutes  and be back easily for city life in the evening, says Borgen, as we warm ourselves with cups of Norwegian coffee. You can walk around for hours without meeting anyone. Or try out a range of winter activities  hiking the many trails, mountain biking, ice skating, fishing, picnicking and, of course, skiing and tobogganing the timeworn runs. If you dont want to head straight back to Oslo, you can stay in municipal sports cabins, very reasonably priced, and scattered throughout the woods. More than 80% of Oslo inhabitants visit the forest, says head forester Jon Christiansen. My father used the forest, my grandfather, my great grandfather. Christiansens team scours the area, talent-spotting trees for London: the chosen few are then groomed like X Factor hopefuls to encourage a strong and symmetrical growth. We mark it and we tend them through the years, he explains. The most important thing is to clear the space around so it gets light from all angles. The forest was also a muse to Edvard Munch, who created etchings and paintings of vampires creeping about in its shadows Standing on a snow-fringed track, we are surrounded by trees and ice. A half-frozen lake cracks and creaks, cubist rock forms jut out of the earth, and in every direction legions of pines dissolve into the white haze.

The business daily Dagens Nringsliv earlier reported that Britains international trade secretary, Liam Fox, had asked Norways trade and industry minster, Monica Mland, to form a bilateral trade working group at a meeting on 14 September. The paper said the request was passed to the Norwegian foreign ministry, which is coordinating Norways Brexit response, where it was turned down as likely to jeopardise Norways European Economic Area (EEA) agreement and inappropriate while Britain was still a full member of the EU. But a ministry spokeswoman said Mland had confirmed in a letter to Fox that Norway was willing to initiate a dialogue in an attempt to minimise any potential future disruption to the bilateral trade relationship. The letter said Norway was flexible concerning the format of the dialogue, within the framework of our respective obligations. No 10 said it was not true that Fox had asked for a joint working group on trade with Norway: That did not happen. Liam Fox has had dialogue with Norway. It was part of an ongoing dialogue between the Department for International Trade and individual states. It was a friendly conversation as opposed to any specific requests. The format  and formality  of preliminary bilateral trade talks is a highly sensitive issue. Fox is eager to begin work on negotiating new trade agreements with non-EU member states, but the UK is legally barred from signing any while it remains an EU member. Last month the Australian trade minister was forced to row back on earlier enthusiastic noises about setting up a bilateral working group to scope out the parameters of a future ambitious and comprehensive Australia-UK free trade agreement. Steven Ciobo said any formal work on a bilateral post-Brexit deal would take second place to Australias trade talks with the EU, and could not begin until Britain had fully exited from the bloc. Norway is not a member of the EU but has access to the single market though its membership of the EEA, which groups EU member states plus three of the four members of the European Free Trade Association (Efta)  Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. Norway has said it could block an eventual UK bid for Efta membership. The European affairs minister, Elisabeth Vik Aspaker, said in August it was not certain it would be a good idea to let a big country into this organisation. It would shift the balance, which is not necessarily in Norways interests. The Norwegian model had been held up by some pro-Brexit campaigners as a possible way for the UK to access the EU single market via the EEA, although the governments insistence on controlling immigration and regaining parliamentary and judicial sovereignty after Brexit may rule that out: EEA membership requires the four EU freedoms, including the free movement of people. Trygve Slagsvold Vedum, the leader of Norways Centre party, had accused the Norwegian government of dragging its feet in response to the Brexit vote, telling Dagens Nringsliv that Britain was Norways biggest export market. Britain accounts for about a quarter of Norways exports  principally oil and gas, which account for nearly 90% of the total, and seafood  and about 6% of its imports."

But an impassioned five-minute address on the need for inclusiveness and acceptance by Norways King Harald last week to 1,500 slightly startled  but ultimately delighted  guests in the park of the Royal Palace in Oslo has gone viral. A spokeswoman, Marianne Hagen, said the palace had received a huge number of requests for an official English translation of the speech, which had received nearly 80,000 likes and been viewed more than 3m times on Facebook. Interest in the speech has been such that Harald, who celebrated 25 years on the Norwegian throne earlier this year, was quizzed about it at length during a state visit to Finland this week, Hagen said. Explicitly backing gay rights, the king, who will be 80 in February, said Norwegians were girls who love girls, boys who love boys, and girls and boys who love each other. He also voiced support for religious diversity, saying Norwegians believed in God, in Allah, in the universe  and in nothing. Calling on people to embrace trust, solidarity and generosity, he said the notion of home could not be confined within national borders. It is not always easy to say where we are from, what nationality we are. Home is where our heart is. Norwegians came, the king continued, in all ages, abilities, heights, family statuses and careers, just as their musical tastes varied from Edvard Grieg to DJ Kygo. In other words, he said.

The Nordic nation of 5 million is struggling to integrate an estimated 30,000 asylum seekers who arrived last year, including 5,500, most of them Syrian, who rode bikes across from Russia. Harald insisted Norwegians came not only from north Norway, central Norway, southern Norway and all the other regions, but from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Poland, from Sweden, Somalia and Syria. If they were surprised by the unexpected royal intervention, many of his citizens seemed genuinely pleased. Im immeasurably proud to be Norwegian, and to have such a great king and royal family, said one commenter, Yngve Gasoy Romdal. Yes, we love this country! Another expressing approval on the state broadcaster NRKs Facebook page, Lars Jacob Schrer, said it was really hard to be republican with this royal family  they are unique, and down-to-earth like most Norwegians. What an example of Norwegian values in practice! Even more enthusiastic was Rizwan al-Huq: This is why we have you, dear king. When monarchy can live hand in hand with democracy, why not support a diverse society and a nation that chooses his own identity with such fine words? Harald, a champion sailor who in his younger days represented his country three times in the Olympic Games, praised Norways beauty, from the high mountains and deep fjords to lush farmland and rolling moors, but urged its unity. My greatest hope for Norway, he said, is that we will be able to take care of one another. That we will continue to build this country. That we will feel that we are  despite our differences  one people. "

Senior Norwegian government members are to hold talks with David Davis, the Brexit minister, in the next few weeks. Some Brexit supporters have suggested that Efta would be one way of retaining access to the single market while honouring the referendum mandate to leave the EU.  Related: Brexit weekly briefing: economy takes centre stage as politics stalls  Norway is not a member of the EU, but it has access to the single market from its membership of the European Economic Area (EEA), which groups all EU members and three of the four Efta members: Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, but not Switzerland. Norways European affairs minister, Elisabeth Vik Aspaker, reflecting a growing debate in the country following the Brexit vote in the UK, told the Aftenposten newspaper: Its not certain that it would be a good idea to let a big country into this organisation. It would shift the balance, which is not necessarily in Norways interests.  She also confirmed that the UK could only join if there were unanimous agreement, thereby providing Norway with a veto. Aspaker said she did not know the UKs plans. EEA membership requires the four EU freedoms: free movement of persons, services, goods and capital. Norway, in need of extra labour, does not oppose free movement, though the issue of asylum seekers and refugees is controversial. An EU special summit in Bratislava in September and the Conservative party conference in October may provide greater clarity on the British governments thinking, Aspaker said. One concern is that Norway, through Efta, has signed trade agreements with 38 countries, including Mexico, Canada, Colombia, Morocco, Kuwait and Qatar. If the UK joined, those trade agreements might have to be renegotiated and future trade deals would become more complex. During the UK referendum campaign, Norwegian government members, including the prime minister, Erna Solberg, repeatedly urged British voters not to follow the Norway example, saying: Do not leave the EU, you will hate it. The largely pro-EU political class in Norway argue that the high price for access to the single market is a loss of sovereignty, since the country is bound by EU decisions without having a vote on how they are taken. Britain was a founding member of Efta in 1960, a free trade organisation that was an appendage to the European Economic Community, the forerunner of the EU. In 1973, Britain joined the EEC. By opposing a British return to Efta, where decisions are made by consensus, Norway would in effect block the UKs chances of accessing the single market via the EEA, since only EU and Efta members can be part of the EEA. Before the summer, Aspaker set up a working party within the foreign ministry to look into how to safeguard Norways interests. She has stressed the need to retain good cooperative bilateral relations with the UK. But there are concerns that if the UK joined Efta, it might usurp Norways dominance of the small club or demand changes to the terms of the agreement. Norwegian Labour party (NLP) officials are due to travel to the UK Labour party conference in September for talks on future relations with the EU. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, told his party at the weekend that it needs to accept the vote to leave the EU, but has suggested the possibility of Norway-style access to the single market. Sources in the NLP said there was growing concern at the consequences for Norway if the UK joined Efta. A source joked that the country might lose its superpower status in Efta, were this to occur. The combined population of current Efta nations is 14 million, compared with the UK population of 65 million. Trygve Slagsvold Vedum, the leader of Norways Centre party, has accused the government of dawdling in responding to the Brexit vote, saying it needs to be proactive in defending Norwegian interests. Audun Lysbakken, the leader of Norways Socialist Left party, has argued that the EEA agreement should be renegotiated with the UKs help, saying countries outside need a better model for cooperation with the EU than the current EEA agreement.  He said he was amazed that his government did not want to have an open debate about a new relationship with the EU. Throughout the spring, the government has been adamant that the EEA is not a good model and it is not something they would recommend to the British. Now they suddenly want to leave it as it is, Lysbakken said. The EEA has created a significant democratic deficit through importing laws over which Norway has little influence. Polls in Norway have suggested that voters are divided over whether Brexit will be good for the country or whether it will signal the beginning of the end for the EU. Nearly 70% oppose Norway seeking to join the EU.  This article was amended on 11 August 2016. An earlier version said the UKs population was 55 million. This has been corrected to say 65 million. "

Brge Brende, who was due to meet his UK counterpart, Boris Johnson, on Monday, as well as the Brexit secretary, David Davis, and the international trade secretary, Liam Fox, said his countrys model of access to the single market without being part of the EU was seen there as a success. This did not mean it would necessarily work as well for the UK, Brende told BBC Radio 4s Today programme. We were very clear that there is no silver bullet in this context, he said. Being a part of the single market, as we are, also means to implement all directives, and we are not in the room when these directives are decided on. But there has been a consensus around this in Norway that it is in our interest to be a part of the single market, and that is what we have to contribute. On top of this we also do funding for countries in the EU that are the new members, but also those that are facing the biggest challenges when it comes to development. Asked if the single market choice facing Britain was the same  to have more control or to be richer  Brende said Norways access to the single market since 1992 had served our country well, with 70% of its exports going to the EU. He said: Formally, youre right, that on the directives we have no formal say. That is part of the price that we are paying.  Brende added: We have also implemented all the four freedoms, referring to the single market principles of the free movement across borders of goods, people, services and capital. Asked if he had any idea yet of the UK governments plans for Brexit, Brende said only that his talks with Johnson, Davis and Fox would look at how we can secure a close relationship between the UK and Norway, moving forward. But he rejected reports that Norway would resist the UK joining the European Free Trade Association (Efta), which provides four non-EU nations with access to the European Economic Area (EEA) single market. If Britain chose to go through an EAA agreement, being a full member of the single market, taking all the directives, contributing to the EU, we have to assess such an interest, he said. But so far, I think, your prime minister, Theresa May, has said youre working along different lines. Efta, which groups Norway, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Iceland, is the only international organisation where Norway is a superpower, he added. There has been increased speculation about whether the government might consider paying to secure access to the single market. Also on Monday, Davis was due to join the chancellor, Philip Hammond, to jointly reassure businesses that they have been working increasingly closely together, amid concerns ministers are split over Brexit strategy. On Sunday, Johnson, said it was pure speculation that the government could pay large sums of money in return for access to the single market. His comments came days after Davis said the government would not rule out the possibility of financial contributions to secure the best possible access for goods and services. The Brexit secretary made the assertion to MPs in the House of Commons, and the idea was reinforced later by Hammond and by Downing Street. Johnson  who was leading figure in the Vote Leave campaign that suggested Brexit would result in an extra 350m a week available to be spent on the NHS  tried to play down the idea on the BBCs The Andrew Marr Show.  That is obviously something that David Davis is considering but it doesnt mean a decision has been taken  I am not going to get involved in the minutiae of our negotiating position before we trigger article 50, he said."

What is the Norway model, how does it work, what does it cost, and might it be suitable for Britain given what we also know about the governments priorities for Brexit?  What is the Norway model?The Norway model is membership of the the European Economic Area (EEA), an extension of the EUs internal market which is made up of the 28 member states and members of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), which includes Norway. In order to join the EEA after leaving the EU, Britain would first have to join the EFTA.  What would be the advantages for the UK?In principle, EEA-EFTA membership would give Britain access to the single market and to selected EU programmes in exchange for a financial contribution but without the additional burdens of being a full European Union member. The UK could benefit from the aspects of European integration it chooses, but avoid those it dislikes, such as political integration.  How does it work?The EEA requires accepting the core principles of the EUs internal market, including free movement of people: in fact, per head of its population, Norway has significantly higher EU immigration levels than Britain. It also entails following the EUs social and product rules in areas such as employment, the environment and consumer protection, which are considered an integral part of the single market. EEA-EFTA countries are bound by whatever legislation the EU adopts in these areas, but do not get to vote on the rules or take part in the decision-making process, beyond trying to influence its early stages. A report for the Norwegian government has said Norway is, in practice, bound to adopt EU policies and rules on a broad range of issues without being a member and without voting rights. EEA-EFTA countries such as Norway are not members of the Council of the EU, and are not represented in the European parliament. One of the prices of preferential access to the single market is becoming a law-taker, not law-maker.  What are the costs?For its membership of the European single market and the EU programmes and agencies it takes part in (mainly research, education, social policy, culture, criminal justice and home affairs), Norway makes a total annual contribution of about 870m. It does not pay into the central EU budget, but transfers money directly to poorer EU states and contributes to specific programmes.  Norways net contribution is difficult to work out because it does not publish figures for its gains from the EU, such as research grants. The group In Facts estimates Norway and the UK pay about the same per person: about 96 per head. But other analysts have reached different conclusions: Open Europe suggests the UK contribution is 139 per person, compared to Norways 107. Would this work for Britain?If it is indeed willing to make a financial contribution, can agree on the amount, and assuming the other EFTA members approve (which is not guaranteed  Norway has expressed misgivings), there is no reason why Britain could not join the EEA through EFTA to obtain preferential single market access.  Doing so, however, would entail accepting EU immigration, which Theresa May has said it is the governments top priority to curb, and abiding by a large number of EU rules and regulations, which would seem to be at odds with the governments other key objective of regaining full judicial control for UK courts and judges. Politically, it may be hard to convince pro-Brexit ministers, MPs and voters that continuing to make payments to the EU (albeit not into the main budget), accepting free movement of people and becoming a law taker rather than a law maker is compatible with the referendum vote.

Its highest mountain back, obviously. Norways government has confirmed that for the centenary of Finlands independence next year it is considering moving the border, gifting its Nordic neighbour a mountain peak that would be the countrys highest point.  There are a few formal difficulties and I have not yet made my final decision, the Norwegian prime minister, Erna Solberg, told NRK, the national broadcaster. But we are looking into it. At 1,324 metres above sea level, the highest point in Finland currently lies on a bleak mountain spur known as Hlditohkka, part of a far larger fell known as Halti, more than 200 miles inside the Arctic Circle. Haltis summit, at 1,365 metres high, is a kilometre away in Norway. But moving the border barely 40 metres further up the mountainside would put Hlditohkkas 1,331-metre summit in Finland  and make the countrys highest point seven metres higher. Geophysically speaking, Mount Halti has two peaks, one Finnish and one Norwegian, NRK explained to bemused viewers earlier this year. What is proposed is that Norway gives the Finnish peak to Finland, because it is currently in Norway.  The peak would be a wonderful gift to our sister nation, said the mayor of Kfjord, Svein Leiros, who with other local politicians has written to the government in Oslo to express enthusiastic support for the plan.  We want to reach out a hand to our neighbour that we will be able to shake across the summit. Nor would mountainous Norway actually be losing much, Leiros said: its highest peak is the mighty Galdhpiggen, at 2,469 metres.

Harsson wrote to the ministry of foreign affairs in July 2015, pointing out that the gesture would cost Norway a barely noticeable 0.015 sq km of its national territory and make Finland very happy.  The border, a straight line drawn in the 1750s, was geophysically illogical, he has since told Norwegian media, and it was unfortunate and unfair for Finland that its highest point was not even a proper peak.  Responding, the foreign ministry said that although it appreciated the suggestion, article 1 of Norways constitution unfortunately stipulated that the country is a free, independent, indivisible and inalienable realm. The deputy chair of the parliamentary scrutiny committee, Michael Tetzschner, also told Aftenposten earlier this year that the plan was bewildering and a joke, stressing the constitution clearly prohibits the surrender by the state of any part of Norwegian territory to another power. But yvind Ravna, a law professor at the Norwegian Arctic university, told the paper the constitution did not apply to minor border adjustments, pointing out that Norways borders with both Finland and Russia had moved in recent times to reflect changes in riverbeds and the shifting position of sandbanks and islets.

It was while our government was in exile in Britain during the second world war that it was inspired to create a <a href=""http://www.dnms.no/index.php?seks_id=136413&amp;a=1"">universal health system</a> free at the point of use, as outlined in the 1942 <a href=""http://gu.com/p/3qke6/stw"">Beveridge report</a>, which paved the way for the NHS.</p> <p>Today, most Norwegians are very proud of our health service. We spend roughly 9% of GDP on health, which <a href=""http://www.oecd.org/els/health-systems/Briefing-Note-NORWAY-2014.pdf"">is about average for OECD countries</a>. But in a country of 5.2m people, this translates to more than $6,000 per capita <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> almost double the spend-per-person in the UK.</p> <p>Our system has undergone immense change in recent years. Until the 1970s, Norway operated a <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.597.1654&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf"">highly decentralised health system</a> funded by local authorities. An act of parliament in 1970 made the state the main funder, and since then a growing proportion of the government<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>s budget, swelled by oil revenues, has gone into health. In 2002, <a href=""https://www.duo.uio.no/bitstream/handle/10852/30303/HORN_2004_1.pdf?sequence=1"">the government took over ownership of all hospitals</a> in the country.</p> <p>How is this relevant to the NHS? Well, against a backdrop of similar systems in both countries, the past few years have seen a concerted attempt to centralise health services in Norway. </p> <p>In essence, this has meant concentrating certain types of surgery in fewer, higher-volume hospitals to improve patient outcomes.

It was while our government was in exile in Britain during the second world war that it was inspired to create a universal health system free at the point of use, as outlined in the 1942 Beveridge report, which paved the way for the NHS. Today, most Norwegians are very proud of our health service. We spend roughly 9% of GDP on health, which is about average for OECD countries. But in a country of 5.2m people, this translates to more than $6,000 per capita  almost double the spend-per-person in the UK. Our system has undergone immense change in recent years. Until the 1970s, Norway operated a highly decentralised health system funded by local authorities. An act of parliament in 1970 made the state the main funder, and since then a growing proportion of the governments budget, swelled by oil revenues, has gone into health. In 2002, the government took over ownership of all hospitals in the country. How is this relevant to the NHS? Well, against a backdrop of similar systems in both countries, the past few years have seen a concerted attempt to centralise health services in Norway.  In essence, this has meant concentrating certain types of surgery in fewer, higher-volume hospitals to improve patient outcomes. On the ground, this has meant the downgrading and closure of smaller hospitals and longer journeys for some patients. In a country like ours, with a population density that is 17 times lower than the UK, this is significant; one extreme example saw elderly patients having to make a 260km round trip for orthopaedic treatment. There have been public protests in many places, not to mention a political storm. The Norwegian minister of health and care services, Bent Hie, was even accused of being eager with the scalpel by a national newspaper for his apparent enthusiasm for cutting services from smaller hospitals.  Hie has pointed out, however, that Norway would need an extra 44,000 health professionals over the next 25 years to keep pace with rising demand from an ageing population, without the reconfiguration of services. As professionals working in the Norwegian health service, we firmly support the rationale for centralisation of more advanced services. Put simply, its in the best interests of patients. It just isnt possible to provide consistently high-quality procedures in rural centres with low volumes. In part, this is due to the greater specialisation in surgical training  the days of generalist surgeons operating on everything from hernias to knees are gone. Weve also found that hospital recruitment in very small rural areas can be a major challenge. The scientific evidence base indicating a correlation between higher volumes and lower mortality is complex and varies across procedures and conditions. However, most medical professionals would accept the principle that the more you do something, the better you get at it.  One study by researchers at Haukeland University hospital in Bergen found that 30-day death rates from kidney cancer were significantly lower in centres that treated more than 40 cases per year. We work for the South-Eastern Norway regional health authority (Helse Sr-st), which serves around half of the population of Norway. In 2008, plans were drawn up for the creation of seven hospital catchment areas, each serving between 300,000-500,000 people. These were to be established through merging smaller local hospitals. The long-term plan for each area is to replace the smaller, older hospitals with one big hospital. So far, three new hospitals have been opened in two catchment areas and two smaller local hospitals have closed. One service that has been centralised is coronary angioplasty. All ambulances in our region are fitted with ECG equipment, allowing staff to take a scan which is sent to a cardiologist. If the coronary artery is completely blocked by a blood clot, patients are sent  by helicopter if necessary  to a centre that offers the surgery. The system is working well  weve been able to concentrate angioplasty in just four centres serving 2.8 million people. Through our participation in Dr Fosters Global Comparators international health benchmarking network, we have access to around 40m data records from hospitals around the world. We can see that our outcomes are among the very best globally. Other international data such as the OECDs Health at a Glance report also supports this. In 2013, the latest available year, Norways mortality rate 30 days after suffering a heart attack was just 7.6 deaths per 100 adults aged 45+, compared to the UKs figure of 9.1. The NHS England chief executive, Simon Stevens, has stated his opposition to what has been termed mass centralisation, while viable smaller hospitals are named as a new care model in the Five Year Forward View. How do you go about judging whether a small hospital is viable?.  With the enormous changes planned for the NHS over the coming few years, centralisation is a subject that wont go away. Our experience in Norway shows that if you follow the data and the evidence, you can make decisions that use resources more effectively and deliver excellent outcomes for patients.

On Tuesday night MPs voted for an accelerated programme of CO2 cuts and carbon trading to offset emissions from sectors such as Norways oil and gas industries, which are unlikely to be phased out in the near future. The minority governments ruling Progress and Conservative parties withdrew their support for the motion at the last minute. But their argument, that ambitious emissions reductions now could interfere with future climate negotiations, was roundly defeated. Rasmus Hansson, the leader of the Norwegian Green party in parliament, said: This is a direct response to the commitments Norway took on by ratifying the Paris agreement and means that we will have to step up our climate action dramatically. 2050 is science fiction. 2030 is closer to us now than the year 2000. The high profile climate motion followed a zero deforestation parliamentary vote earlier this month, which made Norway the first nation to ban public procurements that contribute to rainforest destruction. Norway emits around 53m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent each year and the climate minister, Vidar Helgesen, told parliament that he wanted to offset this, by paying other nations to cut their emissions under carbon trading schemes which expire in 2020. It is incumbent on me to underline that this proposal from parliament is really about carbon offsets, Helgesen told the Guardian. It is not about national emissions reductions beyond what we will contribute, through the EU process. Although Norway is outside the EU, it still participates in the EUs emissions trading system. The wording of the parliamentary motion was left deliberately vague, calling for a smorgasbord of measures to achieve carbon neutrality, with no percentages for how much each should contribute. It said that climate neutrality can be achieved through the EU emissions trading market, international cooperation on emissions reductions, emissions trading and project-based cooperation. Helgesen said: The reason why were not comfortable with this proposal is frankly that the [emissions reduction] methods parliament is pointing to are currently not available and the only one that is available right now, wont be after 2020. The government argues that more quid pro-quo commitments can be won if climate neutrality is used as a bargaining chip after a review of the Paris agreement in 2018. This would also prevent any double-counting of Norwegian emissions cuts in the UN and EU systems. The government plans to return to parliament on the question of how the proposal could be achieved. But the Greens and left groups in parliament say they will mount an ongoing political battle to ensure that the measures adopted go beyond carbon offsets alone.  Our climate neutrality position could mean nothing if it is done that way, Hansson said. Norway cannot claim to be a contributor to the [non-binding] 1.5C target [agreed at Paris], if we continue to push for more oil and gas activity. A Norwegian decision in January to up its fossil fuel production in some of the regions riskiest and most environmentally fragile areas raised eyebrows in the wake of the Paris agreement. This is a totally separate issue, as the climate neutrality goalposts are all about offsets by 2030, Helgesen said. After 2030, it is going to get tougher, and beyond that, even tougher. "

Even big mining nations including China and Russia voted in favour of the resolution at the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) congress. The proposal, put forward by Iran, the Czech Republic, the Philippines and several other countries, called for all states to ban marine disposal of mine tailings for new mines as soon as possible, and to plan a stop to ongoing marine disposal sites. The proposal will still pass despite the two votes against, but is not legally binding. Norway is the worst of the worst environmental offenders, said Silje Lundberg, head of Friends of the Earth Norway. Not only do we stand for half of all mining waste deposits in the sea already, we are planning new ones, she said, referring to plans to dump mine waste in Frde fjord on the west coast and the Reppar fjord in the far northern county of Finnmark. The IUCN is the advisory international body that meets every four years and decides the global conservation agenda for the next period. Norway is represented by its Department of Climate and Environment and the Environment Agency, both of which voted against a ban.  This shows that Norway stands completely alone internationally, only being joined by Turkey. Mine waste dumping in the sea is a horrible practice because you lose all control of where it ends up, said Lundberg. Vidar Helgesen, the countrys minister of climate and environment defended the stance. He said Norway has more than 30 years of experience of mining waste disposal at sea, both in Norway and internationally, and the environmental requirements for this practice have been tightened. Norway is a very special case because of its topography with lots of fjords surrounded by high mountains. There is no evidence to support that deposits [of mining waste] on land are generally better than those at sea, he said. He claimed that it takes between five and 10 years for the fauna on the sea floor to rejuvenate. Lundberg added: Norwegian fjords are what we are famous for, and now we are about to fill them with tailings and mine waste. Norway has been known internationally as an environmental frontrunner, but that is a reputation that is in serious tatters."

Stuart, 41, from Laurencekirk in Aberdeenshire, worked for the oilfield services company Halliburton. He was believed to be on a Super Puma carrying two crew and 11 passengers from the North Sea Gullfaks B oilfield, 74 miles (120km) off the Norwegian coast, to Flesland airport in Bergen when it crashed on Friday. All commercial passenger flights by the model of the Super Puma involved in the crash  an Airbus EC225LP  have been grounded in the UK by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), mirroring action taken by its Norwegian counterpart.  BP and Statoil have also suspended the use of the aircraft model after the accident, so it is unable to carry oil and gas workers, the BBC reports.  Tributes have been paid to Stuart, who was a member of Brechin golf club, where a flag flew at half mast on Saturday. Stephen Rennie, the resident golf professional and manager, told the Mail on Sunday: The whole club is shocked and saddened to hear the devastating news about Iain. He was a very popular member of the club and our thoughts are with his family and friends at this difficult time. A family friend, Charles Aitken, 75, said: My daughter knows his wife, Amy. They are a really lovely family  its an absolute tragedy. In tributes posted on social media, Stuart was described as always a gent and a top bloke. Statoil said the pilots of the helicopter  a Norwegian and an Italian  were staff of CHC Helicopter. The 10 other Norwegian passengers were employed by companies including Schlumberger, Aker Solutions and Statoil. Their names have not yet been released. The aircraft shattered into pieces when it smashed into the rocky shoreline of Tury, a tiny island outside Bergen, Norways second-largest city. Norwegian television showed footage of what appeared to be a helicopter rotor blade spiralling down minutes before the helicopter crashed. A witness, Rebecca Andersen, told the Norwegian newspaper Verdens Gang that the helicopters rotor blades came rushing toward us  Then we heard a violent explosion. Emergency crews pulled the wrecked fuselage out of the sea on Saturday before an investigation into the cause of the crash. A team from the UKs Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) has gone to the site. The Norwegian prime minister, Erna Solberg, wrote on Twitter about the horrifying reports and said she was being kept informed about the rescue work. She said her thoughts went out to all those who had lost a loved one. Forferdelige meldinger om helikopterstyrten ved Sotra. Jeg holdes lpende orientert om redningsarbeidet.

Its challenging, Hans Fredrik Srdal, the mayor of Flakstad municipality, told public broadcaster NRK. In terms of tourism, weve become completely unbalanced this year. Disneys Frozen, released in 2013 with the backing of the Norwegian tourist board, bolstered foreign visits to the country by up to 20%, with the Lofoten archipelago alone welcoming more than 1 million summer visitors last year. Matt Damon is currently shooting part of the science fiction comedy Downsizing, scheduled for release in 2017, on the islands, which while well inside the Arctic Circle are warmed by the gulf stream and popular for their relatively mild summers, dramatic peaks, sheer cliffs and spectacular fjords. Some locals feel enough is enough. Millions of people will see this movie, said Gunnar Skjeseth, owner of the Lofoten Explorer, a luxury cruise ship hired by the production. It may be too much of a good thing if even more tourists come here because of it. Skjeseth told NRK the tourist industry had more than enough to do already. Srdal said it was a positive that the film would put the islands even more firmly on the map  but warned that their infrastructure was already under immense strain. The islands 24,500 permanent residents have already complained of acute traffic problems, a severe shortage of waste disposal facilities and a lack of public toilets, with a small wood near one particularly popular mountain climb now known locally as the forest of shit. Narrow, single-track roads and bridges were unable to cope with the huge influx of hire cars and campervans, Srdal said, while mountain paths and trails leading to some of the islands more sought-after beaches were suffering from heavy erosion.  With tourist numbers forecast to more than double over the next few years, the mayor said drastic measures would need to be taken before next season, adding: I fear a dramatic accident, the accident we do not want to have here. Nature is vulnerable, and requires that we be much better prepared."

Since 2013, a substantial segment of the palm oil industry and the buyers of their product have adopted strong forest conservation policies, often described as No deforestation, no peat, no exploitation.   Related: West Papuan women left isolated and beset by violence under Indonesian rule | Rochelle Jones  NGO campaigns and consumer reactions have built up the pressure. But when the worlds largest sovereign wealth fund, the Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG), withdrew its investment in 23 palm oil companies in 2012, the news sent shockwaves through the industry. The decision also meant the funds policy on climate change would target tropical deforestation as a priority issue. Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), manager of the wealth fund, has since introduced a human rights policy called Human rights  expectations towards companies. It says all companies in which the GPFG invests are expected to respect human rights, integrate a human rights strategy into their operations and risk management, and report on their performance in a comprehensive and accessible manner.  These words send a loud and clear signal  and the financial clout behind them will ensure they do not fall on deaf ears.  Managing investments in roughly 9,000 companies in 75 countries, the size and reach of the $830bn (570bn) fund ensure that its practices and performance are closely monitored the world over. As such, NBIM is in a unique position to induce positive behaviour changes in companies and lead other investors by example. Given NBIMs demonstrated willingness to take action should international companies fail to live up to expectations, the new human rights stipulations could be a game changer in getting the private sector to respect the rights of indigenous people and communities.  Investments in natural resources often lead to human rights violations, and indigenous people and forest communities are especially vulnerable. Forest people in Indonesia have watched with resignation as their customary lands were cleared for palm oil plantations, in contravention not only of their land rights but also of a 2013 ruling by Indonesias constitutional court. In future, though, they may have a powerful new ally, if industry responds to this strong incentive for partnering with local communities. Has NBIM become a political actor? It says not. Instructed by the Norwegian parliament to build wealth for future generations, NBIM is an investor with a horizon of 50-100 years. And to NBIM, long-term financial sustainability depends on social and environmental sustainability. Rainforest Foundation Norway and other NGOs have repeatedly exposed NBIM for undermining Norways large-scale support for rainforest protection. In response, NBIM has publicly declared that it finds palm oil companies massive contribution to deforestation and climate change unacceptable. For a long-term diversified investor, it simply doesnt make sense to allow companies to externalise environmental costs, thereby threatening to increase the volatility of stock prices.   Related: Sami reindeer herders battle conservationists and miners to cling on to Arctic culture  The fund manager reached a similar conclusion when it analysed the projected impact of human rights violations. In decreeing that investee companies should conduct ongoing human rights due diligence, based on the perspectives of those who may be negatively impacted  in relation to all aspects of a business operation, the new policy may sound like the demands of an NGO. But NBIM is simply making clear what it expects, in order to secure its own earnings.  The GPFGs increasingly rigorous expectations are the result of substantial public and political attention focused on the consequences of its investments.  The Norwegian public demands ethical consistency as well as financial returns. Although still far from fully implemented in practice, the funds policies on human rights and climate change set a standard that ought to be followed and further developed by other financial investors. Investors are responsible for the consequences of their investments. And they have power.  Like the Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global, they should link financial sustainability to social and environmental sustainability, paving the way for increasing gains on a triple bottom line of people, planet and profit.

My dream holidays involve independent hotels, food, alt-culture and self-catering houses with owners who understand the appeal of a mid-century Danish chair. So Ive always dismissed cruising  with its gaudy decor and ra-ra entertainment  as tacky and unimaginative at best, socially shameful and environmentally reprehensible at worst. But one day, the editor of a glossy magazine asked if I would test out a cruise. A Disney cruise. To Norway. With a Frozen theme. My friends cackled with laughter. But bearing in mind that my Anna-loving six-year-old would never forgive me for putting my snooty reservations above her pleasure, I went  leaving my views on childrens gender roles, food ethics and aggressive marketing techniques at home. For one week, I tried to find my inner child. And it was liberating and fun and joy-filled and surprisingly enlightening. The ship was the Disney Magic, a floating behemoth with pools, water slides, theatres, magic shows, bars and gyms and spas over all 10 decks. There are four of these ships traversing the worlds oceans; its like Disneyland-on-Sea, except there are no queues and less parental involvement. Our route took us from Copenhagen, my favourite city, up the Norwegian coast, passing Bergen and then Gerainger, the village that inspired Frozens fictional Arendelle. But this is a coastline whose mystique goes way beyond cine-tourism; its a place of looming purple mountains topped with snow and grey-tinged landscapes hiding Viking burial grounds, rugged cod fishing communities and legends of trolls. I spent hours, nursing crap cups of coffee, just gawping. Its so rare and uplifting to see the world from the water that it didnt take long for me to concede that these cruise fans might be on to something. As ships go, the Disney Magic is not the chicest. Its a bit plasticky and, from towels to lights to pudding, there are Mickey ears on everything. Every time the boat docked, When You Wish Upon a Star honked out loudly across the harbour, which made me cringe, and then laugh, too. Theres no getting over middle-aged adults huddled in excitement at the prospect of a hug from Belle. Yet I found myself swept up in the ridiculous illusion of it all. The magic of limitless ice-cream. The magic of reading a whole book in one sitting because I couldnt tear my child away from the kids club (Cinderella is coming later and were going to play bingo with Donald). The magic of not having to make decisions about dinner (guests are on a rotating schedule of restaurants; the food is unexciting but competently cooked). The fantastic staff who keep telling us theyre just there to make the magic happen.

But not everyone in Norway is behind the plan. The wildlife protection group Predator Alliance Norway, for example, has campaign posters that talk of wolves as essential for nature, and a tourist attraction for Norway.  Nothing unusual about that, given its a wildlife group, except that the group is based in Trysil, the heartland of the territory where most of the wolf culling announced by Norwegian authorities last week will take place.  Predator Alliance Norway is an anomaly in this area, a land inhabited by the most fervent advocates of culling  many of them farmers and hunters. Here, you pass cars with large stickers pronouncing Real Men Shoot Wolves to show support for six local poachers who were imprisoned for illegal hunting last year.  Lars-Erik Lie, a 46-year-old mental health worker who founded the group in 2010, told the Guardian: I got so upset and saddened by the locals thirst for wolf blood, and wanted to show that not all villagers are in favour of wiping out this beautiful animal.  Many locals think there should be room for both predators and livestock, but they have kept their mouths shut out of fear for repercussions. Lie has himself been the target of threats.  At the heart of the matter is the conflict between sheep farmers and conservationists. Norway is a large sheep farming nation, unique in letting most of its 2 million sheep roam free all summer without herding, fencing and with little supervision.  As a result, 120,000 sheep are lost each year, and 20,000 of these deaths are attributed to predators, judging by state compensation payouts, which are based on documentation and assessment by the authorities. Beyond that, 900 cadavers found annually are confirmed to have been killed by predators. The wolf accounts for 8% of kills.  Wolves, bears, lynx, wolverines and golden eagles are Norways native top predators.  In 1846, the authorities issued bounties to hunt them down, resulting in all species being virtually extinct by the mid-20th century, The wolf was given protected status in 1973, a watershed in wildlife management for the acknowledgement of its part in Norwegian fauna and in need of protection. The first wolf returned in 1980, though the first breeding entirely on Norwegian soil did not take place until 1997.  In the meantime, a new breed of sheep had invaded the land. The breed of sheep vastly favoured by Norwegian farmers is unsuited to roam around the rugged terrain of the country, said Silje Ask Lundberg, from Friends of the Earth Norway. The sheep is favoured for its size and large proportion of meat, but is a bad climber and has poor herding and flight instincts, unlike the old short-tail land race, considered the original Norwegian sheep race, prevalent on the west coast, where ironically there are no wolves.  Just across the mountain from Lies house in Trysil, is the territory of the Slettsen pack, which has been marked out for a complete cull even though the wolves live within a designated wolf zone.  The framework for predator management has been set by parliament, with local predator management boards setting hunting and culling quotas when population targets have been achieved. The lack of a scientific and professional approach is obvious, said Lie. In January his organisation filed a complaint that the board votes in representatives with vested interests, such as farmers, whereas green party members have been excluded.  At his office in Oslo, Sverre Lundemo of WWF Norway is also puzzled. It seems strange that we should punish the wolf for following its natural instincts, particularly within specially designated zones where the wolf supposedly has priority over livestock, he says.  The Slettsen pack is very stable and of genetic importance. Scandinavian wolves are subject to inbreeding and poaching, and this makes the small population more vulnerable to random events. Culling these individuals can undermine the viability of the entire Norwegian wolf population. According to Lundemo, the decision for culling appears to be based on politics as much as on science. The WWF have examined the case document that formed the base of the decision. This a questionable decision on many levels. The case documents dont substantiate why these three particular territories were singled out for culling, said Lundemo. Despite the population within the wolf zone having almost doubled since last year, attacks on livestock have almost halved. Most of the injuries are inflicted by roaming young wolves from Swedish packs, said Lundemo. Sweden has stricter regulations for sheep farmers, refusing to compensate farmers who dont protect livestock properly. As a member of the EU, Sweden had a planned licenced cull of 10 % of their wolf population of 400 in 2014 reduced following pressure.  Friends of the Earth advocate more suitable breeds of sheep, or cattle, and better fences and herding. WWF is exploring the option to challenge the decision legally before the wolf hunt sets in on 1 January 2017. Back in Trysil, the Predator Alliance is gaining momentum. The group has submitted a 35,000-signature petition for protecting the wolf to the prime minister, Erna Solberg. We humans have become greedy, behaving like nature is there for our taking, said Lie. When you have a population as small as the one we have in Norway now, you have to draw the line."

Celina, 19, who made his Premier League debut against Leicester City on Saturday, last month pledged his future to Kosovo, where he was born, over Norway, where he moved with his family at the age of two.  Related: Leicester stun Manchester City to maintain remarkable title charge  The midfielder, who signed a two-year scholarship with Manchester Citys academy at the age of 15, played for Norway at under-15, under-16, under-17 and under-21 level  and made an appearance for Kosovos full national team in 2014. According to Norways FA, as quoted by the newspaper VG, Celina and his father Eduar made the decision to commit his future to Kosovo only after Norway refused to agree to their demands for playing time. Yngve Haavik, a spokesman for the FA, told VG: What we can say is that it almost became something like a negotiation regarding playing time and we cant operate that way. There is no doubt that we wanted Celina to play for Norway, but that desire has to be mutual, and there cant be any conditions on playing time. It is the national coach who has to decide every time who starts the game and who comes on. I think everyone realises that. Eduar Celina told the paper his son could not make a difference unless he was playing regularly. Bersant was willing to play and make his contribution to the Norwegian country and the national team, he said. But he could not do that by sitting in the stands or by playing just three minutes. We will cheer on the national team, though, and wish them all the best."

Astrup was the son of a pastor in J<c3><83><c6><92><c3><82><c2><b8>lster, a Norwegian village poised between terrifying mountains and glassy water on a lake at the end of a fjord. He stayed in this locale all his life and painted it with an insider<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>s intimacy.

Vibrant shades of it give this exhibition an emerald glow. Astrup<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>s world is a fragile human community surrounded by sublime nature. Wooden farm buildings rise from the ground on low stilts, with roofs covered in grass and moss. The white walls and dark windows of his childhood home face mighty mountains looming above. Women and children picnic in crisp spring air. This little community seems threatened by terrible forces above and below: trolls in the mountains, monsters from the fjord. </p> <p>There is a primitive and ancient quality to Astrup<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>s rural Norway. Much of everyday Norwegian life a century ago remains unchanged from earlier times. His father would not let him visit the exciting Midsummer<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>s Eve bonfire as a child because it was a transparent survival of pagan beliefs. As an adult artist, he glories in its spectacle. One of his ritualistic paintings of the yellow flames, the night air smokey and the enraptured crowds amorous with drink and dancing, shows a boy silhoutted against the fire.

Lets call them rangers and diggers. The first type travel far and wide, finding inspiration in exotic places and grand scenery. The second stay at home and dig down deep into their own world. If JMW Turner was the ultimate ranger, always off somewhere new, his contemporary John Constable was a digger who painted his boyhood scenes (as he called them) over and over again.   Related: Norwegian painter Nikolai Astrup emerges from obscurity  Nikolai Astrup was another digger who painted his childhood surroundings again and again all his life. But he came from a far more startling place than Constables East Anglia. Astrup was the son of a pastor in Jlster, a Norwegian village poised between terrifying mountains and glassy water on a lake at the end of a fjord. He stayed in this locale all his life and painted it with an insiders intimacy. In one picture, an old woman carries a bucket of glowing coals to a rocky river. This strange image comes from local folklore  a Jlster tale had it that a woman warms the soil in this way every spring. Astrups eye is most profoundly local in what he chooses not to dwell on. An outsider visiting Scandinavia might think of snow as an obvious subject. Astrup rarely paints it. Snow appears only in the distance, on bleak mountain tops. It is the enemy. For Astrup, life is green  he paints the fresh vegetation of spring and summer; yellow marigolds in the meadow; trees in the rain; the mad light of bonfires on Midsummers Eve.  He loves green. Vibrant shades of it give this exhibition an emerald glow. Astrups world is a fragile human community surrounded by sublime nature. Wooden farm buildings rise from the ground on low stilts, with roofs covered in grass and moss. The white walls and dark windows of his childhood home face mighty mountains looming above. Women and children picnic in crisp spring air. This little community seems threatened by terrible forces above and below: trolls in the mountains, monsters from the fjord.  There is a primitive and ancient quality to Astrups rural Norway. Much of everyday Norwegian life a century ago remains unchanged from earlier times. His father would not let him visit the exciting Midsummers Eve bonfire as a child because it was a transparent survival of pagan beliefs. As an adult artist, he glories in its spectacle. One of his ritualistic paintings of the yellow flames, the night air smokey and the enraptured crowds amorous with drink and dancing, shows a boy silhoutted against the fire. Is it the young Nikolai, entranced by the ancient magic?  His world view has a Viking quality. Norse mythology pictures the cosmos as a multitude of worlds linked by the great tree Yggdrasil and suspended over the nothingness of Ginnungagap. Astrups homely but precarious-looking rural community is like the Norse Midgard, the human realm or middle earth. Above it are the terrifying mountain ice giants. Below, a void of bottomless water. In some of his paintings the creatures of these alien realms invade the tranquility of June nights. Wheat gathered on poles in the fields appears to shape itself into an army of trolls. A tree by the lake takes on a hideous demonic form.  Astrup even looks like a hobbit in his self-portraits. One drawn in 1927 has fairytale handwriting spiralling from his pipe like a Tolkien manuscript. Its a shame Astrup never met the English reinventor of Norse myth  he might have made a fine illustrator for The Lord of the Rings. He was fascinated by graphic art. Like his contemporary Edvard Munch  who owned some of his prints  he also experimented with woodcut, attempting to recreate the stylised forms and glowing colours of Japanese woodblock prints with his own laborious layering of colours, again and again, over the same image.   Related: Nikolai Astrup: the lost artist of Norway  Poised between the civilised and the barbaric, Astrups paintings have a consciously barbarian, gleefully crude energy that has something in common with the Russian artist Nicholas Roerich, who painted scenes from Viking history and designed the primitivist costumes and sets for the original 1913 production of Stravinskys The Rite of Spring.  For Astrup, too, it is the rites of spring and their culmination in the magic of Midsummers Eve that brings the earth to life and cause the human sap to rise. His art is primally connected to the cycle of nature and the hollows and shadows of a life lived close to the Arctic Circle. I want to go to this eerily beautiful Midgard where the trolls can still be glimpsed on a moonlit night. Painting Norway: Nikolai Astrup is at Dulwich Picture Gallery from 5 February to 15 May  This article was amended on 4 February to correct the spelling of Astrups hometown of Jlster."

Eight of the men had volunteered to go, police said. Immigration minister Sylvi Listhaug said the refugees would be taken to the Russian towns of Nikel and Murmansk. If Norway is to have a fair asylum policy, we need to send back those who are not entitled to protection, Listhaug told parliament on Tuesday evening. Any refugee with a valid Russian visa would be deported, she said. Norways tough new asylum policy was adopted by a broad majority in parliament last year after more than 5,500 asylum seekers cycled to Norway from Russia through the border at Storskog  a safer and cheaper route than risking a rubber boat in the Mediterranean. Some 30,000 people claimed asylum in Norway in 2015.  Related: Bike shortage stems flow of refugees using Russian Arctic route to Europe  However, the UN warned last week that Norway was likely to be in breach of the UN refugee convention. They can end up in a no mans land where they risk freezing to death, Vincent Cochetel, the UN high commissioner for refugees regional coordinator in Europe, said last week. There are large cracks in the Russian asylum system. We believe Norway is wrong to regard Russia as a safe country for people who need protection. In an unprecedented move by the authorities, refugees were told their applications for asylum had been rejected only a few hours before their planned deportations, giving them no chance to appeal, according to Halvor Frihagen, an asylum lawyer in Oslo. I do not know of any similar deportations since the Nazi occupation of Norway during the war, when Jews were arrested and given no opportunity to appeal. It is the most serious situation since that time, Frihagen said, pointing out that Russia had a very poor record on asylum rights. Public opinion in Noway is divided. Some are afraid that too many refugees are coming to Norway, but others show huge support for refugees, Frihagen said.  The government of the populist right and conservatives wants to make a very clear stance that they do not want too many asylum seekers. The European court of human rights rejected a last ditch appeal by Frihagen on Tuesday to halt the deportations. A spokesperson said the court did not give explanations for its decisions. Norways crackdown on asylum would create a black market of paperless people, as refugees would get scared and go into hiding, said Ask Ebeltoft, an activist in Trondheim for the group Refugees Welcome in the Arctic. It is impossible now to seek asylum in Norway unless you swim here from the Middle East, Ebeltoft said.  Related: Bicycles used by Syrian refugees to enter Norway from Russia to be destroyed  Asylum rights groups were particularly worried about people from Balochistan in Pakistan, he said. Its a really dangerous area, we are very scared that the Russians will send them back and they will be killed. Families awaiting deportation in Kirkenes on Tuesday were very depressed and afraid, especially the Syrians, said Ahmed Isam, 26, a Sudanese student also expecting to be sent back to Russia imminently.  At first I was afraid, but if I am afraid I will not survive, Isam said, speaking from the immigration police reception centre in Kirkenese on Tuesday night. The police had picked him up from his accommodation in Trondheim at 5am on Monday morning and brought him here, he said.  Isam, an artist who was interviewed in Cairo by the Guardian in 2014, fled Khartoum because of his human rights activism, crossing the border with Norway by bicycle in November.

The newspaper started to award a bag of coffee and a certificate to any angler who landed a cod over 30kg (66lb). Now the papers records, painstakingly compiled over the decades, bear witness to a remarkable outcome of climate change and far-sighted fisheries management. The catch of monster cod has exploded in the last five years, as the fish have feasted on shoals of capelin thriving in warmer waters. Meanwhile, commercial fishing has been tightly controlled, allowing the fish to age and grow  and grow and grow.  Anglers are catching unheard of numbers of kaffetorsk, or coffee cod, and the Lofoten Post has had to give away almost half a tonne of coffee this year. As of last weekend, 490 giants had been reported, up from 289 last year and just 49 in 2010. The biggest was 45kg (99lb). Managing cod stocks is not rocket science  it is much more complicated than that Commercial fishing and angling are extremely important for Lofoten, and the kaffetorsk have become a concept, almost a brand, says Kai Nikolaisen, the papers official coffee-cod correspondent. I walk through the harbour and fishermen say look, thats the kaffetorsk guy. When I started the job in 2006, we had only a dozen such fish every year. Commercial fishermen support the Lofoten Posts less than scientific observations. Weve seen a lot of big cod this season, thats a fact  this year seems to have been extraordinary, says Jan-Erik Indrestrand for the Norwegian Fishermens Association, the professional fishing union. Anglers have come from abroad to enjoy the bonanza. Last month British pensioner Bert Williams reeled in a 42kg (93lb) animal, the largest ever caught by a Briton, further north up the coast at Srya. Two weeks earlier a Swede, Marica Eriksson, broke the world record for a fish landed by a woman, at 38kg (84lb).  The phenomenon of massive cod is partly due to the warming climate, which has greatly expanded the area where the cod can feed, says Knut Korsbrekke, a specialist at the Institute of Marine Research in Bergen. But Norway also began to place limits on the commercial harvest in the 1980s, and this is bearing fruit, he says. In 1989, after an extreme cooling event in the Barents Sea when stocks declined rapidly, Norway and Russia agreed to close down the fishery altogether.  Related: Cod's country: pensioner beats UK angling records with 42kg catch  Try doing that in the EU, says Korsbrekke, who compares the huge success of Arctic fisheries management with the North Sea, where overfishing has meant cod populations are still only a quarter the size they were in the 1970s. North Sea cod stocks are a terrible mess, he says, as countries haggle over quotas. In contrast, Norway and Russia have a long history of successful cooperation. Managing cod stocks is not rocket science  it is much more complicated than that, Korsbrekke says. Each female lays some 8m eggs, 1.3mm across; at peak spawning in early spring, the density of eggs can be as high as 28,000 per square metre. Were all the Barents Sea spawn to be placed side by side, an egg at a time, they would stretch for more than 1bn km, Korsbrekke has calculated. But only two eggs per female survive to become mature fish. It takes between 10 and 15 years for them to grow to 30kg, and perhaps as long as 20  fish can be aged by counting the growth rings in an ear bone, like a tree. And while some cod can live 30 years, the potential for them to grow so large depends on availability of food, and modest harvesting rates. Favourable conditions due to climate change have happened before  the 1930s saw a similar warm period when cod stocks took off, and huge fleets of trawlers landed hundreds of thousands of tonnes before the war. But it is not easy to predict whether the current trend towards an abundance of Barents Sea cod will continue, Indrestrand says. Russia is reporting vast amounts of small cod at great depths in the east, possibly related to falling temperatures. It is normal that the bigger fish arrives first, while in the later part of the season we see a more mixed population with a lot more of the smaller, more normal, fish, Indrestrand says. So the big cod may not reflect the real situation in the stock. Commercial fishermen used to be at loggerheads with scientists demanding stock control, says Korsbrekke. But we have established a level of trust  we are working for the fisherman too, to create a healthy ecosystem that can be harvested sustainably. As soon as they realise that our objectives coincide, they cooperate. Norwegian anglers have had their share of luck, with the warming climate roughly doubling the area where the cod can thrive and reach such staggering size. But they are also reaping the rewards of human intervention, Korsbrekke says. It pays to utilise the resource in a rational way."

The 41-year-old British man killed in the crash was named as Iain Stuart, from Laurencekirk in Aberdeenshire. He worked for oilfield services company Halliburton. A statement released by relatives of the 41-year-old said: We as a family are devastated at the loss of Iain in Fridays tragic helicopter crash in Norway.  Iain was a loving husband and devoted father to his two children and as a family we are heartbroken. He was a caring son, brother, uncle and friend to many.  We are appreciative of all the messages of support and kind thoughts.  We now ask, as a family, that we are allowed some privacy at this difficult and sad time to grieve and come to terms with our loss.  A statement from CHC, issued to the Press Association, said: It is correct that the helicopter returned to base on Tuesday 26 April. The pilot had a warning light and returned to Flesland according to procedure.  At Flesland the helicopter was inspected, according to procedure, and a part was replaced. Wednesday, the helicopter was taken on a test flight, where the warning light reappeared, the helicopter returned to base, changed another component, the next test drive was completed without any warning light. Thursday, the aircraft completed six commercial flights, all without any indication of problems. None of the changed parts were physically connected to rotor or gearbox.  The statement added: These returns to base are essential for flight safety and part of operating in a highly regulated industry. Sometimes an RTB can be for technical issues, other times it is much more mundane.  At all times, CHC has met or exceeded the requirements of our regulatory authorities and our customers, and continues to offer a compliant service.  Speculation about the cause of the accident is unhelpful and we must also be careful to respect the feelings of the families who perished in the tragic events of Bergen. Tributes have been paid to Stuart, who was a member of Brechin golf club, where a flag flew at half mast on Saturday. Stephen Rennie, the resident golf professional and manager, told the Mail on Sunday: The whole club is shocked and saddened to hear the devastating news about Iain. He was a very popular member of the club and our thoughts are with his family and friends at this difficult time.  A family friend, Charles Aitken, 75, said: My daughter knows his wife, Amy. They are a really lovely family  its an absolute tragedy.  In tributes posted on social media, Stuart was described as always a gent and a top bloke.  Field operators Statoil said the pilots of the helicopter  a Norwegian and an Italian  were CHC Helicopter staff.  Ten of the passengers were Norwegian nationals and were employed by companies including Schlumberger, Aker Solutions, and Statoil. Their names have not yet been released. Emergency crews pulled the wrecked fuselage out of the sea on Saturday. A team from the UKs Air Accidents Investigation Branch has gone to the site. On Saturday, the Norwegian prime minister, Erna Solberg, tweeted about the horrifying reports and sthat she was being kept informed about the rescue work. She said her thoughts went out to all those who had lost a loved one. All UK commercial passenger flights using the same Airbus EC225LP Super Puma model have been grounded by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), mirroring action taken by its Norwegian counterpart.  BP and Statoil have also suspended the use of the aircraft model after the accident, so it is unable to carry oil and gas workers, the BBC reported.  EC225 Super Puma helicopters were previously grounded for a period in the UK after two crashes in Scotland in 2012. Both incidents, in which all passengers and crew were rescued, were blamed on gearbox problems.  More than 6,500 people have now signed an online petition calling on the CAA to permanently remove the EC225 from service. They include Audrey Wood, who lost her son Stuart when a helicopter carrying workers from a BP oil platform crashed off Peterhead in Aberdeenshire in April 2009."

Shes opening the days trade to mark the start of export week. The minister for small business, industry and enterprise, who is firmly in the remain campaign for the EU referendum, follows up the ceremony with a speech focused on why small businesses need us to remain in the EU. While a panel of business representatives discuss exporting opportunities, Soubry answers some of our questions before heading back to parliament.  With Soubry fired up post speech, we ask her what a vote out would mean for small businesses. If we have Brexit, we dont know what we will get, she says. What we do know is that it will take at least two years to untangle ourselves. I dont think that theres any doubt that there will be a serious impact on our economy, it will undoubtedly go into decline because the one thing business likes is certainty. Soubry says the out campaign will be seeking a UK trade deal such as that of Norway, which is part of the European Economic Area (EEA). Soubry argues that while Norway pays for the EU privilege of free movement of labour and goods they are not involved in EU decision making processes. It will be absolutely the worst of all deals, she says. In their 2015 party manifesto, the Conservatives set themselves a target of 100,000 more UK companies exporting in 2020 than in 2010 and 1tn in exports. The remain campaign might say Brexit would scupper these targets, but are they even realistic if we stay in? They are tough targets, but we are right to aim high, she insists. The manifesto also suggested the government would cut regulation for small businesses. And yet, since the Conservatives were voted in, small business concerns around red tape have not abated. Two issues that have particularly angered the community post-election include the VAT Mini One Stop Shop (Vat Moss) and the spectre of quarterly tax returns. Soubry is adamant that the changes to tax filing will not create quarterly tax returns, but rather that records will need to be updated quarterly. I think maybe we got the messaging a bit wrong, she says. [The changes are] actually a very good idea because it means as a small business youre on top of how much tax youre paying. You should be doing these things in any event  knowing what your cashflow is like, knowing where you are financially in your business.  Asked whether the government was taking into account small businesses concerns on the issue (as well as the recent Administrative Burdens Advisory Board report), Soubry says: I honestly think that people have misunderstood what it actually is. Its phased in, its not going to be some ghastly overnight thing. There will absolutely be time for people [to learn the skills, such as how to use online accounting software] and it will actually improve peoples business.  Vat Moss (which changed regulations for those sellers of digital services in the EU meaning that VAT is now charged in the country where the products are bought, rather than where the seller is located) was brought in by the EU.  So one might question if it, and similar regulations, could be cut if we voted out? Soubry had nothing to add on Vat Moss. But, she says: We could still have the rules and regulations and not any say. In her view, by voting to stay in, the UK will have a positive impact on its relationship with the rest of the EU. I genuinely believe it will enhance our standing and will strengthen our ability to make the argument for further reform. Another tenet of Soubrys argument for staying is the free movement of labour. She says: I dont think [the topic] has been properly debated. And I can understand why, we dont want the debate about the EU to be all about immigration  we want it to be about the economy and the positive benefits the EU has.  But, she adds, the reality is the free movement of labour is a positive for the UK economy. That freedom and liquidity of workers is critical to so many small businesses. We need to wake up to the reality of what migration is about. They come here to work. The idea that they take British jobs is not true, they add huge value to our economy.  A counter argument might be, why cant we train up unemployed EU citizens to do the jobs those EU workers are filling? We should absolutely train up UK workers  but it takes time to do that. And the reality is that there are a lot of EU workers that come here to do jobs that British born workers will not do. We know we have a skills shortage, but a lot of these jobs are very low-skilled.

Ineos, the chemical group, said that its own gas carrier arrived in Norway on Wednesday with 27,500 cubic metres of American ethane on board. Shipments to Ineoss UK refinery at Grangemouth are scheduled to start later this year. This is a strategically important day for Ineos and Europe, said Jim Ratcliffe, chairman and founder of Ineos which has spent $2bn on different aspects of its import programme over five years.  We know that shale gas economics revitalised US manufacturing and for the first time ever Europe can access this essential energy and raw material source too, he added. Ineos has chartered eight purpose-built vessels which it says will create a virtual pipeline across the Atlantic with gas from the Marcellus shale of Western Pennsylvania shipped out via an export terminal near Philadelphia.  Ethane is a component of natural gas that is separated out and can be turned into a liquid to make it easy to transport. The gas is cooled to -90C for the seaward journey of 3,800 miles to Europe. Ineos says the US shale will complement the dwindling supplies of gas from the North Sea. But the shipments have triggered rows about the British governments own shale strategy which has faced drilling protests from locals and environmentalists at early sites such as Balcombe in West Sussex. This is pure industry hype typical of the masters of spin that Ineos attempt to be, said Hannah Martin, Greenpeace campaigner. One would imagine that they are talking up their exports of shale gas from the US to Europe in an attempt to make themselves seem like major and credible players in the UK shale market. But this certainly doesnt mean that they will frack successfully here. Nick Grealy, an independent UK gas consultant, said that Ineos ethane import plans and existing liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports from other countries such as Qatar made no sense when there were known reserves under the ground in Britain.  It is crazy to bring in this high carbon (due to shipping emissions) gas with no tax levied on it in Britain rather than producing our own shale. We are importing gas and exporting money, he argued.  The gas from Ineos is not the first shipped out of the US. Last month that prize went to Cheniere Energy which exported LNG to Brazil. In the past exports of oil and gas were banned as the country was a net importer. But the massive ramp up in US shale oil and gas production which has seen the price of both oil and gas plummet worldwide, has encouraged Barack Obama to change the law. Environmentalists still fear that shale gas  whether from the US or Britain  will crowd out investment for renewables and undermine a rush away from fossil fuels of which it is one. But gas enthusiasts believe the fuel, much lower in carbon content than say coal , can act as a bridge to a lower carbon world."

The temporary suspension of expulsions after Russia raised security concerns is a setback to Oslos attempts to plug the gap in its Arctic border and implement a strict clampdown on asylum.   Related: Norway tells refugees who used cycling loophole to enter to return to Russia  It follows a week of confusion at a detention camp in Kirkenes, near the border, where scheduled expulsions were repeatedly postponed and refugees were briefly arrested and then freed while opposition leaders questioned the policy.  Nevertheless, 13 asylum seekers were deported by bus to Murmansk on Tuesday night. Among them was a Yemeni refugee, whose case has cast further doubt on the Norwegian governments view that Russia is a safe destination for refugees.

Russia returns failed asylum seekers to their country of origin unless they have funds and a visa to go to a third country. Mohammad Ahsan Rashid, Abdulahs lawyer in Oslo, said deportation to Yemen would mean Norway is sending him straight to death. Refugees applying for asylum in Russia face many obstacles, according to Yelena Burtina, of Grazhdanskoye Sodeistviye (Civic Assistance Committee) in Moscow. If they manage to get through, usually they are refused anyway, judges normally side with the immigration services, she said. The European court of human rights has criticised Russia for returning people to countries where they are at risk of being tortured or treated inhumanely. The court condemned Russia in October for deporting three asylum seekers to Syria.   Related: Norway criticised over deportation of asylum seekers to Russia  Norways immigration minister, Sylvi Listhaug, said on Thursday she would ask the countrys immigration directorate to check on the situation of Abdullah and another deported Yemeni refugee, but the agency does not track asylum seekers once they have been returned to Russia, a spokeswoman said on Sunday. We consider Russia a safe place to return to,. We can try to find out what happened to them, but there is not much we can do about it. Norways parliament rushed through legislation in November paving the way for deportations amid a panic that the country was unable to cope with the numbers seeking asylum via Russia. Some 5,500 came via the Arctic route in the autumn.  The move is part of a crackdown on asylum across Scandinavia, which critics have described as a race to the bottom as Europes northernmost countries struggle to cope with tens of thousands of people fleeing war and persecution in the Middle East, Asia and Africa.  Jon Ole Martinsen, senior advisor to the Norwegian Organisation for Asylum Seekers, said the country should lift the threat of deportation from those with temporary visas until the situation in Russia has been fully researched. We have heard rumours that people in Russia have been sent back to Syria this past month, and we know for certain they have been placed in prisons in very bad conditions.  Related: Cutting aid in order to support refugees will allow extremism to thrive | Kiai, Nordlander, Hardh, Hammarberg, Engesland  About 80 refugees, mostly from Syria and Afghanistan, are still awaiting deportation from the Kikenes camp. On Sunday they were allowed to seek police permission to leave the camp briefly, but the nearest town is 20km away and there is no transport. Refugees complained to the Guardian that there was insufficient food and no medicines.  Ahmed Isam, 26, a Sudanese student, wrote in a letter to Listhaug on Sunday that his treatment at the camp reminds me of the many times I was arrested by the repressive Sudanese regime for my peaceful activism and for defending my rights and the rights of exploited people. Three refugees, including a pregnant woman, escaped from the camp on Wednesday and were given refuge in Kirkenes parish church. Police have told local media they may still break down the door but did apologise for strip-searching a woman who helped the escape. She and two others may still face a fine or up to two years in jail. It is astonishing that the government acts so brutally, Atle Sommerfeldt, bishop of Borge, told broadcaster NRK. Olav ygard, bishop of Nord-Hlogaland, said: Human dignity is being violated. A persons worth is infinite, no matter where they are from. Some 31,000 people applied for asylum in Norway in 2015, of whom 18,431 people received the right to permanent residence and 7,825 were refused, including 500 children. "

The Norwegian drama, which has loosely been likened to Channel 4s popular teen-targeted series Skins, has become a global digital hit, whose teenage fans have petitioned the broadcaster to add English subtitles for international fans.  Related: Shame: a Scandi TV sensation for the social media generation  Simon Fuller, the man behind the Spice Girls and the international Idol TV franchise, such as American Idol, has struck a global deal with the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation, the shows broadcaster, to remake Shame for English-speaking audiences. Fullers XIX Entertainment will produce a version of the show for the US and Canada, which is expected to be sold to other English-speaking markets such as the UK. Shame is an important show, said Fuller. There is precious little content created primarily for a teen audience and Shame provides this with great honesty and integrity. The show packs a punch and is leading the way in exploring multiplatform storytelling. Shame, which launched in Norway in 2015 and is now on its third season, has been a massive hit. It focuses on a group of 16-year-olds and has had audiences in its home country as high as 1.3 million of a total population of 5 million. The shows success has been attributed to the use of compelling real-time storylines that take an honest look at issues such as addiction and coming to grips with life as a gay teen. It uses unknown actors, many of whom still have day jobs such as telemarketing, and it has been innovative in its embrace of social media to promote the series. Clips of the show are posted in real time online, so if there is an event after school it is posted the same time it would be in real life, which makes the characters and plots feel real.  Clips posted throughout the week are assembled into one episode, which can be from 17 minutes to 50 minutes long, which is then aired on TV. Viewers and fans can interact with the characters via their profiles on Facebook and Instagram at any time, while text messages between the characters are also posted online to heighten viewer interest and anticipation. It has become an enormous hit in Norway and has the potential to become an influential show in America, where there is simply nothing like it, said Fuller. Scandinavia and Norway in particular is at the forefront of innovation and creativity in the shaping of the worlds digital and creative industries right now. Haakon Moslet, NRKs head of youth, said the remake of the series has the potential to change the rules in the American TV market. We are honoured that [Fuller] wants to take our baby to the next international level, he said. Moslet said the American Shame would be a completely separate production from the Norwegian version, with his production team focused on creating season four of Skam in its home market. We feel certain that Shames integrity will be respected, and that the unique authenticity that is at the heart of our show will capture a very large audience, said Ole Hedemann, head of formats at NRK. Shames secret, the accurate portrayal of high school kids, gives the audience something to think about  and at the same time something to love."

Sylvi Listhaug, who was appointed Norways first immigration minister in December with promises to crack down on the refugee flow, said this week that all those who crossed at Storskog without a transit visa would be sent back to Russia, according to English-language Norwegian news site the Local. The Norwegian national police directorate said it was trying to avoid sending the refugees back on bicycles, but it has ordered that bikes ditched after the crossing be gathered up for use by the foreigners who will be returned to Russia, a police official, Jan Erik Thomassen, told the broadcaster NRK.

From the moral panic surrounding A Clockwork Orange to Larry Clarks Kids in the mid-90s and Girls in the last decade, stories of young people being out of control have intrigued and dismayed censors and the general public for decades. Now Norwegian web-drama Skam is about to enter the arena of teen tales that may produce palpitations, with the remake set to hit US screens (renamed Shame) via American Idol producer Simon Fuller. On the face of it, Skam seems like an obvious investment for someone who has made his money from backing largely youth-driven successes that others didnt see coming. Its the latest Nordic TV hit (which thankfully cant have noir attached to it), a show which one-fifth of Norways population watched weekly. It cleverly gave its characters real-life Instagram accounts, and garnered a following so committed to getting the message out that fans translated the show for English speakers themselves and hounded journalists to write about it.  Related: Shame: a Scandi TV sensation for the social media generation  The shows episodes, which range from 20 to 50 minutes, slowly reveal the world of a group of 16-year-olds in an Oslo high school, with clips posted at the time of day the events are supposed to be happening. Its already three seasons deep (all are available online via NRKs site), with each series focusing on a particular teenager from a group of makeshift friends. Eva, the protagonist of season one, has doubts about her boyfriend Jonass commitment to her; in season two Noora deals with her feelings for hard-to-read alpha male William; and in season three Isak comes to terms with his own sexuality. It may not sound that revolutionary, but its the frankness and calmness with which these subjects are dealt with that make Skam something special. Aesthetically its beautiful, with vistas of Norway that would turn an editor of Cabin Porn pine green with envy. But beneath the Kanken backpacks, the grassroots marketing and the perfectly helixed beanie hats, there is a drama thats hard-hitting without ever feeling like its falling over itself to deal with issues. There isnt the same contrived controversy that came with Skins or voice of a generation baggage that followed Girls around. Its closest relative is probably Australian series Heartbreak High, which presented a gritty but humorous look at life in a Sydney high school in the mid-90s. Like that show, the home lives of the students are just as important as the life lessons dished out in the schoolyard, with absentee parents getting as much flak as the kids on screen. Its refreshing to watch a show about teenagers where the protagonists arent self-obsessed cliches. There are certain tropes: Vilde is the naive, socially awkward striver, for example, but mostly the characters are realistically flawed young people dealing with growing up. When issues do arise, theyre often punctured before theyre allowed to approach anything resembling a moral lesson, as when a teen pregnancy storyline is suddenly hijacked by the school nurse, whose bleak jokes about menstruation could come straight from a Sarah Silverman routine.

Insecure and Atlanta are obvious candidates for television that, like Skam, garnered huge online followings, and did so by creating worlds that related to people on their terms.

Tradition has it that the weather that night sets the pattern for the next six months. This coming midsummer night, both sides of Norways political divide will be looking up to skies for a storm brewing from across the North Sea that could transform their political climate not just until Christmas, but for a generation.  Pro- and anti-EU parties are planned in Oslo for the night to await the news from the UK referendum. A Brexit vote will create conditions for a new debate about Europe here in Norway, said Hilde Nyln, the general secretary of the leftist-led No to Europe campaign. It will provide us with a completely new direction and options. Most of the pro-EU Norwegian government fear that debate.  Related: The Norway option: what is it and what does it mean for Britain?  On the other side, Norways European minister, Elisabeth Aspaker, dreads the idea of the UK joining her country outside the European Union. The EU is facing so many challenges on migration, growth, security how we follow up the agreements at Paris on climate change. It would be a huge step backwards if the UK was to leave, and would have huge implications for us, says Aspaker, a member of the centre-right Conservatives.  Either way, wealthy Oslo  with its designer shops, extravagant new opera house and even more extravagant cost of living  knows it is more than a bystander in the Brexit debate, and has instead become a battleground in the UK referendum itself.  In the UK, disputes circulate about whether the Norwegian model is one that could be followed in the event of the country leaving the EU. Could the European Economic Area, the little-understood agreement that has allowed prosperous Norway, along with Liechtenstein and Iceland, to be half in, half out of the EU, become the model for the UK?   The EEA brings together all EU states and three of the four members of the European Free Trade Association, which has 25 free trade agreements with 36 countries. Those three non-EU states, through the EEA agreement, are part of many EU structures, notably the single market, but importantly remain outside the euro, fisheries, agriculture, justice and home affairs. The EEA and an EFTA secretariat in Brussels manage the relationship between the EU and the three non-EU states.  Politically it is easy to see why Eurosceptics in Britain feel tempted by the Norway example. Bombarded by the governments risk message, the leave campaign has struggled to describe what lies beyond the exit door and make Brexit seem worth the risk. Internal divisions have caused the campaign to float conflicting options: Switzerland, Canada, the World Trade Organisation or a bespoke British arrangement.  As the price for access to the EUs single market for its fish and energy, Norway accepted in 1992 the free movement of workers and now probably pays more per capita in grants to EU states than the UK. Oslo airport at the weekend is jammed with many migrants returning to their homes outside Norway. Worse, Norway does not sit or vote on any EU committees and is portrayed as a willing serf waiting by the computer to download its instructions from Brussels. It is a case of not being in Europe, but still run by Europe. Some say we are more integrated in the EU than some full EU member states, says Aspaker. But this may underplay ways in which the Norwegian debate can be misread and manipulated.  Many sceptics cite Norway and the surrounding EEA bureaucracy as an important interim staging post rather than a final destination. They recognise it is a temporary, if imperfect, escape route for the UK providing access to the single market without all the political controls. A weekend YouGov poll commissoned by the Adam Smith Institute found strong support for the Norway option as the means to a soft Brexit  Figures such as Nyln argue that Norways legal agreement with the EU provides greater flexibility than the political class pretends. She claims supporters of full EU membership  the bulk of the parliament  play up a powerlessness in an effort to persuade the public to join the EU. The Norwegians have voted twice in referendums against EU membership and polls at present show 72% opposition to joining. Ulf Sverdrup, the head of an international thinktank, was commissioned by the government in 2010 to review the Norwegian-EU relationship. He has meticulously charted the degree to which Norway had been Europeanised. Though the figures are contested, his report shows 75% of EU laws are incorporated in Norway. The number of EU legal documents had gown eightfold, leaving a constitutional patchwork that few Norwegians understand.   Related: No single market access for UK after Brexit, Wolfgang Schuble says  Sverdrups 900-page report might have reopened the debate on a membership application, but came out in 2012 at a moment when Norways economy was booming and Europes was sagging.  Most Norwegians, said Aspakar, are happy to leave arrangements as they are. We feel we are Europeans and yet we can now do whatever we like. Sitting in her office in the ministry of foreign affairs, she added: It is us politicians in Norway that feel this lack of democracy when you see all this legislation we are taking in without having a say when decisions are made. Aspaker manages the patchwork Norway-EU interface every day and, along with the EEA bureaucracy, has to track what the European commission is planning. She says Norway has as many as 50 experts permanently seconded in the commission advising the EU on issues such as fisheries, climate change and energy. In addition, there are 30 Norwegian civil servants in Brussels representing every Norwegian government department apart from culture.  Our mission to the EU is the largest that we have. There are people from every political area, and if you ask the NGOS, the unions and even local and regional political forces, they all have offices in Brussels, just to be close to the commission, the parliament and points of decision, said Aspaker. Three-quarters of our exports go to the EU, so it is vital the relationship works. The best strategy is to have a say in the very early stage. It is much tougher if you ask for changes late. Dialogue is best. The prospect of the fifth biggest economy wanting to apply to join the EEA after Brexit perplexes her. If the Brits are against all the regulations made in Brussels, I think the EEA way is not the solution. Being an EEA member means you are not at the table, yet you have to take in much of the legislation. When you listen to the debate going on on the leave side in Britain, it is hard to imagine that the EEA should be a solution to their problems. Being an EEA member means you are not at the table, yet you have to take in much of the legislation Aspaker could not imagine, for instance, how free movement of workers could be removed from the EEA agreement. The EUs four freedoms, including the free movement of citizens, are necessary for a business friendly environment. We have really needed the workers from the rest of the EU. I do not know how our economy would have coped without, including in construction, and engineers in the oil industry, she said. Yet the No to Europe campaigns chief researcher, Morten Harper, says Norway could assert its independence far more than it does within the context of the EEA, and by extension so could the UK if it ever joined the club after leaving the EU. Norway for instance chose voluntarily to join the Schengen agreement, in part to maintain its open borders with Scandinavian countries. In the next few weeks the Storting, the countrys parliament, is to vote on whether to make its financial services subject to the EU supervision. Norway could have done more to resist EU expansionism. Harper claims Norway has greater flexibility than it exercises to reject an EU directive by saying it is not relevant to the EEA agreement. And its fees to the EU are in fact grants that Oslo views as a moral obligation to tackle poverty, not as a price for access to the single market, he claims.  But it is hard to see the EU being obliging to Norway and Britain if together they tried to use the ambiguities in the EEA agreement to assert independence from Brussels.   The EU could easily scuttle the Norwegian economy by putting up trade barriers. As Aspaker pointed out: Fresh fish stuck at borders will not remain fresh for long."

Their exhibition devoted to Astrup at the Dulwich Picture Gallery will be one of the first major showcases of his work outside his own country. Yet as Dejardin and Stevens travelled to Jlstravatnet, the remote lake in north-west Norway where the artist spent most of his life, a fellow passengers face lit up in instant recognition of their blurry photocopies of his work. Astrup! she said. You know he is our hero in Norway. The images were so ubiquitous  hanging in schools, public buildings, in her mothers, aunts and grandmothers homes  that as a teenager she was bored of them. But after living abroad, she came to love his contorted rocks and trees, shimmering lakes, flowers spilling like lava down mountainsides, dark threatening forests and bonfires blazing in the eerie light of a midsummer night.  Related: Nikolai Astrup: the lost artist of Norway  Stevens was astonished when she first encountered Astrups work on a visit to Norway while researching another artist. I feel a kind of missionary zeal about Astrup, she said. He is so very good, so distinctive, so sure of himself and the experience he wants you to share in his work. He is not just a naturalistic landscape painter. He was fully aware of what was happening in contemporary art, the work of the neo-impressionists, the expressionists and the cubists, but he decides to turn his back on it and devote his life to painting Norway. Dejardin said Astrup was a perfect fit for a Dulwich exhibition: Hes another in our illustrious line of exhibitions of artists youve never heard of, but youll never forget once you do encounter them. Astrup studied in Copenhagen and Paris, but in 1902 abandoned his studies and returned to Norway. He spent the rest of his short life painting not just his home country, but the landscape of that one lake. He continued to travel to study, making long detailed notes  he dismissed the works of the pre-Raphaelites at the Tate in London and was enchanted by the Constable sketches of landscapes and clouds in the V&A  but always returned to his lake. His talent was recognised as a student and he had avid collectors, including his world famous countryman Edvard Munch, who owned three of his prints. (Astrup did not repay the compliment: Everything he does is supposed to be so brilliant that it doesnt have to be more than merely sketched, he wrote to a friend.) But Astrup was hopeless with money, usually in debt and his health was wretched. Dejardin said: He spent years in his fathers deathly parsonage, which was ill health in building form. Part of the cold damp house, instantly recognisable from Astrups paintings, still stands. Astrup suffered all his life from asthma and later contracted tuberculosis: the window of the room where he was often confined to bed overlooked the graveyard where three of his siblings were buried in one week. Some of his best-loved works depict bonfires flaring on the hillside on midsummers eve, often with an onlooker in the foreground gazing yearningly towards the music and dancing. Astrup was forbidden as a boy to join what his father regarded as pagan celebrations. His landscapes are often haunted: a tree becomes a troll, claws reaching towards a snowy slope resemble a naked woman, the ridge of a mountain is the profile of a dead friend. He married the 15-year-old daughter of a local farmer  even in those days eyebrows were raised, said Dejardin  and they had eight children. The home they made is preserved as a museum and stands on a plot so steep they had to scramble up from the lake shore on their hands and knees, his redoubtable wife, Engel, usually carrying a baby, until Astrup built a track and terraces for planting and the village-like collection of small wooden houses.  Norways devotion to his art is part of the reason for his obscurity: there is only one print and no painting in any British collection and a handful in the US. Although loans have come from the major collection of his work in Bergen, most of the pictures have been prised from private collections, many from walls where they have hung since they were bought from the artist.

Fifa said Siem had taken up a newly created position in its reformed structure, and would begin work before the arrival in June of the governing bodys recently appointed secretary general, Fatma Samoura, a UN official from Senegal who has never before worked in football. For the past four years, Siem, who had a spell running the Premier Soccer League in South Africa, was secretary general of Norways FA while Infantino held the same position at Uefa. He is credited in Norway with creating the Handshake for Peace project with the Nobel Peace Centre, which was later adopted by Blatter. Speaking to Dagbladet in January 2014, Siem said: Im sure no Norwegian has more respect than I do for the Fifa president Sepp Blatter. He is actually a role model. After Blatter was forced to resign amid the continuing corruption scandal, Siem stood by his praise for a man who had held the football family together, saying Blatter deserved respect for what he has done for the development of football in the third world. He has made Fifa into a cohesive organisation. Siem leaves Norways FA after a difficult few months, having recently given in to pressure to make public what officials claimed in expenses. Siem said he had only resisted previous demands for transparency to avoid revealing where he had travelled, risking damaging commercial negotiations. For me personally theres now an advantage to showing my receipts, Siem said. They will show that theres a very good reason for them. Norwegian football has become very international. Asked if he would disclose his new salary at Fifa, Siem said: After what Ive been through, I will not say anything about it. I put together all my expenses and said yes to everything, but for two months I was hung on the gallows. He said he was very proud and surprised, in a good way, to be appointed and said that the organisations current troubles made it the ideal time to join. Ill work on reforms, then on streamlining Fifa  Its a privilege. It could not be better timing. Infantino told the Norwegian FAs website: I am very happy to have Kjetil Siem aboard. He has international experience and has shown the kind of qualities I need around me in efforts to reform Fifa. The appointment comes days after Domenico Scala, the head of Fifas audit and compliance committee, resigned over fears new rules would compromise independence and impede investigations into corruption."

A new Oslo-based app has taken that idea further and is giving power directly to the people who, when it comes to urban planning, are too-often left out of the conversation: children. Two years ago, Vibeke Rrholt, who has worked in traffic safety in Norway for more than15 years, began compiling a report that looked into road safety for children in Oslo. Commissioned to work for Norways Agency of the Urban Environment, Rrholt had to come up with a way to encourage the capitals 44,000 children to walk or cycle to school. What better way to find out how they feel about their own security than by asking them directly? The Traffic Agent app was created to understand childrens concerns about their own safety in the city and is part of Oslos move towards greater sustainability and away from cars. The new leftwing city government announced last year it planned to ban private cars from the centre by 2019 as part of its initiative to halve greenhouse gas emissions. The government said that all increase in traffic in Norway should now be done by cycling, walking or public transport, explains Rrholt. Indeed, the country is on a sustainable push: there have been reports that the sale of fossil fuel-based cars will be banned in the hope of all cars running on green energy by 2025.  Related: How tweeting about floods became a civic duty in Jakarta  Increasingly, cities across Europe are investing in different ways to become greener and more liveable. Peter Staelens, project coordinator at Eurocities, says the nature of the investment has changed. Originally there was a lot of investment in roads and infrastructure for cars. I think that changed because practically all major cities have recognised that we need a modal shift away from the car so that more investment is needed for sustainable alternatives. These alternatives include investments in public transport, electric mobility, cycle- and pedestrian-friendly areas. Its about making better use of existing infrastructure, improving the capacity and flow of the network, adds Staelens.  With 347,000 (290,000) in funding from the city, the Research Council of Norway and consultancy Capgemini, Rrholt needed to find ways to create an environment where parents would feel that it was safe enough for children to walk to school. I was supposed to make a traffic report on all roads in Oslo. Thats a big job, she comments. So I thought, why dont we ask the children how they feel on the street? The best way to do that, she says, was to turn to gamification. Using a smartphone app, with the idea of users being secret agents for the city, children can send immediate reports on their route to school when they come across, for example, a difficult crossing on the street or an area of heavy traffic. Their location is tracked using GPS, so researchers can pinpoint exactly where these hazards are.  Related: Pokmon: gotta catch them all, even in the library  The idea of crowdsourcing information to understand what needs to be improved in cities is nothing new. In Jakarta, Indonesia, the city started exploring how citizens could help address major issues including flooding and congestion. The Emergency Management Agency set up a project called PetaJakarta to create a real-time, crowdsourced map of flooding in the city. In San Jose, California, city authorities have set up what they describe as a real-time civic engagement tool whereby residents download a free app, and can send, for example, a photograph of litter connected to GPS that goes directly to city hall. Asking children for feedback has never been done before in Norway, Rrholt says. She believes this is having a positive impact on children, and could be rolled out to other cities. I received a telephone call from the mother of a little boy who had reported some bushes that meant he couldnt see when he was crossing the street. And two days later the bushes were cut. She phoned in saying hes so happy that he could make this happen. Rrholt says that using information provided by children through the app, authorities have rebuilt several big crossings and made more pavements to make it safer for pedestrians in the past year. For example, several students reported that they liked to walk through privately-owned land on part of their journey to school as it felt safer, so Oslo municipality agreed with the owner of the property that if the government created a crossing, path and handrail, he would maintain it.  Data protection is an issue that might deter parents and teachers from encouraging children to use this app, but from the beginning the Traffic Agent has anonymised data. The app is integrated with Norways school software platform which generates a code for each child to use as a login. This data is visible only to the school and project team. Rrholt also maintains that when the children start using the app from home, they dont get a report until they move at least 200 metres away. To keep some privacy for the children, not all the information is shared with parents and teachers.  Although the app is in use only in the capital, Rrholt says the director of the Oslo municipality wants to see it shared across Norway, so other communities can use it at a low cost. It is a slow process: so far only 35 out of 135 schools have taken part. I still dont think we have changed the number of children walking, says Rrholt, and I hope that we will. I hope that when we can show the results  which we try to do on Facebook, as thats where the parents are  we can get more schools to cooperate with us. Cities like Oslo are having to strike a balance between becoming both accessible and liveable, and it seems that crowdsourcing information from residents is the most logical way forward. Traffic Agent shows that children can even have a hand in how cities are planned  like where the safest place to build a school is  at just the click of a button.Talk to us on Twitter via @Guardianpublic and sign up for your free weekly Guardian Public Leaders newsletter with news and analysis sent direct to you every Thursday."

Now that revolution is entering a second phase. No longer confined to the kind of high-end places that do innovative things with sea urchins and foraged sorrel, these days and the list of the citys most exciting restaurants and bars includes spots that arent expensive, or even all that Nordic. What they share are the big flavours and attention to quality that many of their owners learned at Noma. Eat Christian Puglisi broke with the Nordic doctrine when, as one of the first of Nomas chefs to venture out on his own, he opened Rel six years ago. Last summer, he decided to explore his Sicilian roots with Bst, a pizzeria where the charcuterie is from organic pigs, the mozzarella is made by hand from Danish milk, and the pies are baked in a wood-burning oven in the centre of the restaurant (pizzas from 12). Hija de Snchez brings the same attention to detail to tacos (three tacos for 10). Founded by Nomas former pastry chef, Rosio Sanchez, its a market taqueria that grinds its own corn and makes its own tortillas. And Tuesdays to Saturdays in summer, former Noma head chef Matt Orlando complements his seasonal menu at Amass with takeout fried chicken and coleslaw (19). On a warm night, a box of crisp chicken and a glass of wine in its waterfront garden may be the citys best picnic. Drink Copenhagen has one of the worlds highest concentrations of natural wine bars  another legacy, at least in part, of Noma. One worthy recent arrival is Gaarden og Gaden, a lively spot with a list heavy on French and Austrian bottles (7 a glass), and a mean croque monsieur. For something a little stronger, Balderdash serves delicious, inventive cocktails (a recent concoction included an extract of beaver gland) in a cosily renovated building that dates from the 18th century (10 a cocktail). Stay Urban House (dorm beds from 20, doubles from 100) opened last year in the trendy neighbourhood of Vesterbro, and is clearly aimed at a young crowd. Part hotel, part hostel, it is stylishly, if simply, designed, with a wide variety of onsite extras, including a bar and a tattoo shop.  If you see one thing Do it from a bike. Copenhagen is routinely ranked as the most bike-friendly city in the world and has around 450km of dedicated routes. A cycle hire programme, City Bike, launched in 2014 (look for the stands of big white bikes that operate with the swipe of a credit card, 2.75), but theres also a rental shop on nearly every corner (about 10 a day).Lisa Abend is a journalist and author based in Copenhagen  At a glance Beyond its red-hot startup scene and thriving music industry, Swedens capital is making a culinary comeback with a focus on affordable cuisine. A rising number of bakficka (back pocket) restaurants, run by Michelin-starred chefs, means great value without special reservations. Find cool, offbeat cafes in Stockholms eclectic Sdermalm neighbourhood, modern fusion restaurants in its stermalm district, and vintage charm in historic Gamla stan (Old Town). Eat New restaurant Mother (lunch buffet 7-11, dinner 6-15) focuses on healthy meals packed with flavour and cooked in sustainable ways which respect Mother Earth (hence its name), through thoughtful care of animals, plant life and people. Slow-cooked cuts of beef are served with roasted organic root vegetables, and there are broad options for vegetarians, vegans, gluten-free, lactose-free, and other allergy sufferers. Teatern at Ringen is a refreshing take on a mall food court, except its kiosks are run by Michelin-starred and celebrity chefs. Try gourmet hotdogs by Michelin-starred Magnus Nilsson of Fviken, exquisite 100% ecological vegan dishes from Maximillian Lundins The Plant, truffle ravioli and slow-cooked 63C eggs at CAOS, run by Operakllarens chef Stefano Catenacci, and many more (prices from 3 to 13). To fika like a local  which means a coffee break with delicious pastries  head to Muggen on Sdermalm, with its 1970s-style decor and large windows, perfect for people-watching. Grab Fairtrade coffee or eco-friendly teas with organic pastries, such as chokladbollar (chocolate oat balls) and kanelbullar (cinnamon buns), or sip healthy smoothies made with organic fruit, vegetables and seeds. Drink Sway to local bands at Debaser Medis Club (cocktails 12), where you can chill out over raspberry mojitos on 1970s-style bar stools, before dancing the night away. Corner Club (cocktails 12-15) is an unpretentious modern bar in Gamla stan serving eclectic cocktails with funky names like Cloud 9, which mixes cloudberries with bourbon and lemon, or Rattlesnake  a mix of rye whiskey, lime, sugar, egg white and absinthe. Stay Docked at Riddarholmen in Stockholms harbour, with gorgeous views of Gamla stan, Mlardrottningen Yacht Hotel (doubles from 85 B&B) offers a taste of the citys maritime flair. Built in 1924 and converted into a floating boat hotel (botel), it has 61 cabinscorrect on three decks  from modest-sized to sprawling. If you see one thing Get lost on the lush island of Kungliga Djurgrden, which is the royal park and home to the citys best museums, such as the Vasamuseet (admission 11.50, under-18s free), which houses the Vasa warship, which sank in 1628 in Stockholms harbour on its maiden voyage and was salvaged almost intact.Lola Akinmade kerstrm is a Stockholm-based writer, photographer and editor of Slow Travel Stockholm At a glance Europes fastest-growing capital (theres been a 22% population hike in the past 10 years) has recently seen its downtown and industrial sectors undergo a massive transformation, with warehouse conversions and rebuilding projects, such as the area around the new Opera House or the vibrant, village-like Vulkan complex. This has given rise to bars, bistros and coffee joints run or inspired by young innovators: 2015 Bocuse dOr winner rjan Johannessen from the restaurant Bekkjarvik Gjestgiveri, 2004 barista world champion Tim Wendelboe of the eponymous coffee bar, and 2000 winner Robert Thoresen of Mocca and Java. There are starred chefs  Even Ramsvik at Sentralen and Esben Holmboe Bang of Maaemo  and all this comes with the fresh air, mountains and a fjord packed with islands. Despite Norways reputation as an expensive place, local chefs take pride in making excellent food and drinks at reasonable prices. Eat Oslos new food hall, the Mathallen, is part of the new Vulkan development, in a former industrial area on the Akerselva river, which divides Oslo. Mathallen consists of numerous stalls with shared spaces, where you can sit and enjoy food from around the world: south-east Asian streetfood at Atelier Asian Tapas; confit duck, foie gras, cheese and wine at Ma Poule; Italian ice-cream at Paradis Gelateria, or seafood and fish and chips at Vulkanfisk for around 10. The centre of the downtown revival is recently pedestrianised Torggata, where among a run of new Nordic eateries (Arakataka, Caf Sr, Lokk, Peloton, Taco Republica, and Wnderburger) is the feted Jor (meals about 10), which serves simple, local food such as baked beetroot with blackcurrants. Nearby Fredensborgveien has also been transformed, with vibrant cafes, bars and quirky shops (Chez Colin, Fredens caf and Den Gode Caf, for example). The cheap and cheerful Bon Li gastrobar (dishes 11-16) is a hot spot in a small 1814 house, using Norwegian ingredients to make Spanish-style tapas. A sample dish is tartar of tuna, tomatoes, dates and sesame seeds. But the great thing about Oslo is its majestic surroundings, so take a picnic, jump aboard a ferry and go island-hopping around the Oslo fjord to enjoy the views. Buy cooked shrimps from the fishermen at the City Hall pier and wine at the Vinmonopolet (the off-licence with a state monopoly on selling alcoholic drinks above 4.5% in Norway), which is two minutes walk away in the Aker Brygge area. Some islands, such as Nakholmen and Lindya, do have grocery shops that open in summer. Ferries go from the City Hall and tickets cost 2.80, the same as for the tram. Drink Cosy up with a cairpirinha and enjoy live bands at Caf Brasil on Youngstorget, a plaza with numerous bars and eateries. The best place for dance music is Bl, a graffiti-adorned warehouse-style club (it used to store gold and diamonds) with big-name DJs and bands supplying the beats and an terrace to cool down on. Prices are pretty good for Oslo, with beer at 8 and burgers about 10. Finish off at Bar Boca (no website), at 36 Thorvald Meyers gate, a tiny 1950s-style cocktail bar that serves excellent drinks for about 15 and the biggest Cuban-style tuna sandwich in Oslo, for under 10. Or grab a cheaper beer and watch the world go by on the busy main street in Grnerlkka. Stay City Box at 6 Prinsens gate (doubles from 50) has a self-service reception and neat but small rooms. Its a few minutes walk to Oslos main shopping street, Karl Johans gate, which stretches from the station to the castle. But for more offbeat shops and coffee bars, head to the side streets. If you see one thing Take a walk on the roof of Oslo Opera House (free), which has become the capitals main attraction, thanks to its unusual, sloping architecture, designed by Snhetta. From here, take in views of Oslo, the mountains and the fjord islands. There are usually rooftop events, from pop-up art shows to concerts, and world-class ballet and opera inside.Karl Eirik Haug is an Oslo-based contributor to Dagens Nringsliv At a glance Reykjavik is known for colourful houses, offbeat charm  and high prices. With gastropubs and boutique hotels opening on every corner,, to cater for the ever growing number of visitors, it may seem like the city is beyond the means of many. But, as the Icelandic national football team has just proved, nothing is impossible. Eat Brau & Co is a new artisan and organic bakery in downtown Reykjavik, selling sourdough bread baked to co-owner gst Einrssons own recipe, croissants and cinnamon buns (3) that are worth every calorie. If the delicious smell doesnt lead you in the right direction, the whole building is covered with a mural by local street artist Youze, making it hard to miss. In Skerjafjrur, the Bike Cave is a combined bike shop and burger joint, where youll find burgers at fair prices with plenty of vegetarian and vegan options (luxury burger with bearnaise sauce or lamb steak sandwich 7, veggie burgers 5). And if youre all sweaty, coming straight from a bicycle tour, the Bike Cave even offers shower facilities for a small fee.  In one of Reykjavks historic downtown buildings, designed by the former state architect of Iceland, Gujn Samlesson, is Aptek Restaurant . Although the only thing youll get for a tenner is the soup of the day, its 18 lunch offer (sea trout and rack of lamb, for example) is fine dining for the budget-conscious. Drink Petersen Svtan is a new rooftop bar in one of Reykjaviks historic buildings: Gamla B. Once a cinema and later the home of the Icelandic Opera, Gamla B is now a popular music venue, and Petersen Svtan is the perfect place for a few cold ones and snacks before a show.It offers one of the best views in the city from the outdoor area, and happy hour runs from 11.30am to 8pm (beer 3.60, wine 4.50). Public House on Reykjaviks main drag offers a reasonable selection of craft beers and yummy snacks  duck chopsticks (8), scallop ceviche (8.95). Albeit short (3pm-6pm), its happy hour is especially budget-friendly, with a pint starting at under 3. If cocktails are your poison, you cant go wrong with Slippbarinn at the Reykjavk Marina Hotel by the up-and-coming Old Harbour. It has an awesome drinks selection and impressive happy-hour offerings  its most popular cocktails are a lime-leaf gimlet and the classic margarita (both 7.20). Stay Although the Reykjavik Downtown Hostel (dorm rooms from 35, doubles 150) is not flashy, the location is central  in a residential street a stones throw from the harbour  and the staff friendly. If dorms dont appeal, there are private rooms with en suites. For a nearby watering hole, try the flight of Icelandic craft beers at Microbar (five beers for 17). If you see one thing Pay attention to the charming little details as you walk around the city. Picturesque, toy-town, corrugated houses, beautiful murals, fascinating sculptures and friendly cats give Reykjavik a special quality that makes you fall in love with it.Auur sp runs the I Heart Reykjavik blog "

At a time when the amount of revolts in this years annual general meeting season are coming thicker and faster than those in recent years, the Norway oil fund has revealed it is preparing to target high pay. Yngve Slyngstad, chief executive of the fund, told the Financial Times that the absolute level of pay  not just the way deals were structured  was becoming an issue. We have so far looked at this in a way that has focused on pay structures rather than pay levels. We think, due to the way the issue of executive remuneration has developed, that we will have to look at what an appropriate level of executive remuneration is as well, said Slyngstad. The Norges Bank Investment Management is so large that it holds stakes in most major companies. It supported the controversial pay deal for BPs chief executive, Bob Dudley, which was voted against by a majority of investors but, according to the FT, the fund voted against pay at Anglo American and also at Weir. Weir has faced the largest rebellion of this AGM season and was forced to abandon potential share awards for its top management team, after 72.4% of shareholders voted against its pay policies. We are looking at how to approach this issue in the public space. We will choose the right instance for the right case of voting, Slyngstad said. The remarks by Slyngstad come as a long list of London-listed companies prepare to hold their AGMs over the coming days, including Reckitt Benckiser, whose chief executive was paid 23m in 2015, double the amount the year before. Two banks, Standard Chartered and bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland, along with Rolls-Royce, GlaxoSmithKline and hedge fund Man Group, are also holding meetings. Data compiled by the corporate governance consultancy ISS Corporate Solutions (ICS) shows that two pay deals have already secured no votes  those at BP and Smith & Nephew  compared with none by this stage over the previous three years. The average level of dissent for advisory remuneration report resolutions across the FTSE All Share continues to outpace that evidenced in recent years, said Stephan Costa, executive director at ICS. More critically, we are seeing companies failing to secure majority support with others narrowly passing, thereby underscoring the depth and breadth of investor sentiments on pay this annual meeting season, Costa said.

Yuval Labkovsky was returning to her hotel with her grandfather, after eating in a Thai restaurant, when she was set upon. Labkovsky was lightly injured in her hand during the stabbing attack and released after treatment in hospital.  According to a report on the Hebrew version of the Ynet news website Labkovsky described witnessing the attack and then being injured herself.  On the way back from the hotel, I heard screams and saw two men running toward me, she told the site. I was afraid that it was a terror attack and was sure the two men were running away from the incident. I approached the first and felt a pain in my hand. I thought I was just hit, but it turned out he was the stabber. The second man, who was chasing him, was the man who tried, and later succeeded, in catching him. I saw a woman lying on the floor, covered in blood. Her husband supported her. Suddenly I realized I was also bleeding, she added.Im not afraid in Israel, so I have no reason to start being afraid in London, she says.  2.37pm BST Jo Loughran, interim director of Time to Change, the mental health anti-stigma campaign run by Mind and Rethink Mental Illness, has urged the media to ensure any reporting of a mental health element to the Russell Square attacks is informed and balanced. She points out that the overwhelming majority of people with mental health problems will never pose a risk to others. She said: We understand that the police have released an update about the tragic incident at Russell Square stating that mental health is an increasingly significant factor in this case. The media must rightly report on this angle but we encourage them to do so responsibly.  There have been a number of horrendous acts of violence committed across Europe over recent weeks. As the media look to unpick these extremely complex incidents to explore motivations and reason we urge journalists and editors to provide well informed and balanced coverage of mental health. Millions of people experience mental health problems every year and the overwhelming majority will never pose a risk to others.  2.28pm BST A spokeswoman for the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) said two Australians were injured - a man who is already out of hospital and a woman who is expected to be discharged shortly.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has confirmed with London police the condition of two Australians injured in a stabbing attack in Russell Square, London. A man and a woman both sustained non-life threatening injuries. The man has already been discharged from hospital while the woman is expected to be discharged soon. Another Australian woman was at the scene of the attack, but was not injured. Consular assistance has been provided to the man and one of the women and DFAT is attempting to contact the other woman involved to offer consular assistance. If the woman is discharged, that would leave one person (presumably American or British as the Israeli woman has been discharged) still in hospital   1.54pm BST US ambassador to the UK Matthew Barzun has posted a tribute to the American victim on Twitter. Heartbreaking news that a U.S. citizen was killed in #RussellSquare attack.

Updated at 12.33pm BST  12.22pm BST Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said the police have focused on five strands of work:  - Interviewing the suspect- Speaking with the suspects family- Witness accounts- Searches- Full intelligence review of the suspect by police and the security service He said that they searched a property in north London this morning and are planning to search another in south London.  12.09pm BST A Norwegian national of Somali origin has been arrested on suspicion of murdering an American woman and injuring five others, including Britons, in what was described by police as a spontaneous attack.

While the investigation is not yet complete all of the work we have done so far, increasingly points to this tragic incident as having been triggered by mental health issues. Indeed at this time we believe it was a spontaneous attack and the victims were selected at random. Rowley said officers had interviewed the suspect and his family, and had searched addresses.  The woman murdered was an American national, Rowley said, those injured were Australian, American, Israeli and British. This morning weve searched addresses in North London and we will search another in south London. I emphasise that so far weve found no evidence of radicalisation that would suggest the man in our custody is in anyway motivated by terrorism.  11.54am BST Rowley said none of the people in hospital have life-threatening injuries.  11.52am BST Rowley says the suspect was a Norwegian national of Somali origin. There is no evidence he was radicalised. At this point we believe this is a spontaneous attack and the victims were selected at random. Police believe it was as a result of mental health problems, based on interviews with the suspect and his family.  11.50am BST The Metropolitan police assistant commissioner, Mark Rowley, is speaking outside Scotland Yard. He says the murdered woman was from the US and the injured are British, American, Australian and Israeli. Updated at 11.55am BST  11.30am BST A woman who witnessed the aftermath of the Russell Square stabbings has told the BBC how she saw a man running away from police, carrying a knife with blood on his hands. Jodie Parry was in her hotel room when she heard a commotion.  As he was running down the street he was turning to see if the police were coming close. I could hear the policeman screaming stop, dont move, dont go any further, just stay where you are and he turned around and continued running. He just wasnt prepared to stop ...He was actually carrying a knife in his hand and he had blood on his hands.  Parry said the attacker was out of her sight when he was restrained by police. They had actually gone out of my vision at that point, but I did hear the Taser, and at that point I just heard a little scream and then it kind of went silent.  11.21am BST The BBC has brief footage of the suspect in the Russell Square attacks being arrested: BBC EXCLUSIVE: Eyewitness footage of Russell Square incident: pic.twitter.com/ii1muJUUh6  11.18am BST The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, making a scheduled speech in Dagenham, east London, has begun by expressing sympathy to the woman who was killed and thanking the police for their response.

Taking down the forensics tent. Police say they want to get things back to normal as quickly as poss #Russellsquare pic.twitter.com/ixPSA15Bga  11.04am BST The Met Police commissioner, Bernard Hogan-Howe, has confirmed that mental health remains a substantial focus for our investigation. He has said his thoughts are with those affected and praised the police response as professional and proportionate. My thoughts are with the family of the woman who was murdered and those who were injured. A normal night out in our busy capital has ended in horrific circumstances. Our investigation is moving very quickly and our detectives have been working hard throughout the night. As we have already made clear, mental health remains a substantial focus for our investigation. Every day in London, my officers patrol and carry out operations to catch criminals in the knowledge that they face risk and danger. I am proud that last night our specialist firearms officers were on the scene in six minutes and, using only a Taser, detained the subject. That demonstrates our commitment to use force in a professional and proportionate way. Their swift response undoubtedly helped to prevent more people from getting injured. Across our capital today you will see more police officers, armed and unarmed, to reassure the public after recent events overseas. We will protect our capital and those who live, work and visit our city. Updated at 11.06am BST  10.58am BST Mental illness is a significant part of what Metropolitan Police officers deal with every day and they get 600,000 calls about it a year. They are called to far more incidents involving mental health problems than robbery or sexual offences, a report by the mental health charity Turning Point found in 2013.  On pages 11/12 the report states that:  In 2012 there were 61,258 mental health related calls; this is 21,741 more than robbery and 47,203 more than for sexual offences. The Metropolitan Police Service review also stated that it has been estimated that 15% to 25% of incidents are linked to mental health. Using this estimate the daily contact rises to a minimum of 1,626 calls per day -- the equivalent of around 600,000 calls per year.  10.53am BST Ellie Cattle, 21, who is staying in a hotel on Bedford Place, off Russell Square, told the Press Association she heard police shouting: Put it down, put it down. I looked out of my window because I heard sirens. I could see police - three police vans - coming down the road, and all I heard was them shouting Put it down, put it down.  They sounded urgent for him to put it down. Then I heard what sounded like a gunshot, but it must have been the Taser. After that they just stopped shouting. I didnt hear any screams from anyone.   10.47am BST Alex Hall, 18, (on the right in video) said he and his friends came out of a restaurant in Russell Square and saw police trying to resuscitate a woman. We were walking along and we saw three police cars and an ambulance. They were doing CPR on a woman lying on the ground. We thought it must have been someone having a heart attack. The police were shouting at people to get back. The others in the video are Reuben St Ledger, 18, (middle) and George Baker, 18. All are from Sheffield. St Ledger said they had seen the Metropolitan Police announcement that there would be an increased armed police presence in London before they visited and were not deterred.  10.30am BST Spanish tourists Anna Calderon (right) and Laura Gomez (centre) said they saw one of the victims, a blonde woman in her 20s or 30s, running northwards up Southampton Row. Gomez said: We saw a woman with her hand holding her side. She was running and shouting I need a hospital. I need a hospital. A man who looked like he was in his 60s and a woman stopped a taxi and helped her. We had just said goodbye to a friend who lives here in London and we saw this. We didnt understand what was going on because there was no blood. It was about 10.35pm. Calderon said:  When we got to the hotel we heard the sound of ambulances. But we didnt know anything until we saw what had happened this morning on the TV. The women, from Madrid, said the attack did not deter them from coming to London. Calderon said:  Scared? No, because I think it is an incident that could happen anywhere and we live in Madrid and we had the terrorist attack on the train so we know what the risks are.  10.26am BST There are three vans full of police outside Marylebone station. They dont seem to be doing anything, just sitting there. One told me: Its because of what happened last night. Were not expecting anything bad to happen, these are literally just reassurance patrols. Asked if they were waiting to go out on patrol or whether they were just going to sit in the van, he answered: Just waiting for now.  10.18am BST The two hotels that overlook the street where the incident occurred, the Imperial and the President, do not have CCTV cameras that face onto the square. A porter at the imperial said their CCTV cameras look inwards and they have informed police. One guest at the President, Michel Godbout, who has been visiting London from Canada, said: About 10.30pm, I was in my room and I heard a woman screaming - a couple of times in one minute, then I didnt hear anything. I was almost asleep, I heard police after that but didnt look out the window. My view is blocked by trees. I only found out what happened this morning when I turned on the TV, if I had known I would have gone out to help or something.  10.17am BST Responding to the polices statement that mental illness was a factor in the stabbings, Professor Sir Simon Wessely, the leading psychiatrist and president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said that killings by people with psychiatric problems had been falling for the last 30 years.  But, Wessely added, much more needs to be done to help alienated, disturbed, troubled adolescents and young people with mental health problems, a very few of whom are at risk of committing violence. However, he cautioned against any attempt to increase the number of people detained due to psychiatric problems. He said: We should be very careful about looking for new compulsory powers to lock people up. We already have a very carefully thought-through Mental Health Act, which allows certain people to be detained and compulsorily treatment, in certain circumstances, for mental illness. But neither radicalism nor terrorism is a mental health diagnosis or disorder under the meaning of the Act.  We should be improving services for alienated and mentally troubled adolescents and young people, to help their mental health. But we should be careful not to do things that will increase their alienation, which can then make them more not less vulnerable to radical influences. He added that these are people who are hard to reach and that mental health services for young people were woefully underfunded. The leader of Britains psychiatrists said that he was talking about extremely alienated adolescents and young adults, who do have an increased prevalence of mental health problems. Some have psychosis, or forms of autism, or depression or complex relationship difficulties. But all of those are quite common anyway. The link between mental illness and violence is an extremely sensitive subject.  We know that some people, so called lone actors, do commit awful crimes, for example in school killings in America and the killings in Norway. Theres a link with mental illness, thats true. Looking back at the history of people who have committed offences like this does show increased risk [that the assailant had psychiatric problems], thats true. These offences are quite rare, thank God. But there is definitely an increased risk.  Updated at 2.40pm BST  10.06am BST Fernando, a Brazilian Londoner, who works nearby, said he was cycling home through Russell Square last night when a Spanish family asked him to stop and call the police and ambulance because a lady had collapsed.  There were three people stabbed. The older woman was slumping against the gates, and it was another two people. One of the Spanish family was comforting the older woman.  I thought they were friends, but then I realised that they were just passing. No-one knew each other. He said the two injured people were a man aged around 40 to 50 and a lady aged around 30. When the police arrived a few minutes later, he realised the lady had not collapsed, she had been stabbed in the back and had been bleeding. The Spanish family - a mother father and two daughters - told Fernando that a young man ran past in black shorts and a white T-shirt hiding his face with his arm and just began stabbing people with his right hand. It was a very random and quick attack.  The moment the police arrived, they asked them if the man had been shouting.  They said that he didnt say anything. They said that when he stabbed the people he didnt shout or scream anything. The family believed the attacker he was on his own.  9.38am BST There are a number of hotels in and around Russell Square and the Evening Standard has spoken to some of their staff about what they heard or saw.  Manuel Simo, 32, a supervisor at the Royal National hotel in Bedford Way, said:  At first, people were confused and thought it was a traffic accident. When they realised what was happening people were screaming and running away from a guy who was holding a knife. Apparently he was just stabbing people randomly  its horrible. People ran away in the direction of the British Museum.  People are scared to go out in the street. They dont want to go to the shop to buy water or food. Its very sad. A night porter at the Grange Clarendon hotel told the Standard  I could see four police officers restraining him, holding him face-down on the floor.  He wasnt struggling I think he knew it was over. One police officer was about to get his handcuffs on him and was speaking into his ear. Others were searching the street for something he threw.  9.27am BST Scotland Yard has removed any reference to terrorism in its latest update in what is a small but potentially significant change. In the original release assistant commissioner Mark Rowley said:  Early indications suggest mental health is a significant factor in this case and that is one major line of inquiry. But of course at this stage we should keep an open mind regarding motive and consequently terrorism as a motivation remains but one line of inquiry for us to explore. In the most recent update, Rowley says:  Early indications suggest that mental health was a factor in this horrific attack. However we are keeping an open mind regarding the motive. The change suggests Scotland Yard are more confident that mental health was the driving factor behind the attack.  9.10am BST The Met Police have also released some more details of their response to the incident: Police received the first call just after 10.30pm reporting a man armed with a knife was assaulting people at Russell Square, Camden. Numerous other calls were made by members of the public between 10.30pm and 11pm with reports of a man attacking people with a knife between Russell Square, Montague Street, Bloomsbury Square and Great Russell Street. Armed officers attended the scene within approximately five minutes of receiving the first call.   9.03am BST The 19-year-old suspect has been discharged from hospital - he was Tasered during the incident -and is now in custody at a south London police station, the Met police have said. He has also been formally arrested on suspicion of murder. A Met police spokesman said: We continue to focus our lines of inquiry on mental health while retaining an open mind regarding the motive.  8.51am BST These two police officers carrying semi-automatic carbines were keeping guard outside the National Gallery, in Trafalgar Square, in central London. We deal with everything from having strong words with someone to lethal force, one said. There will be many armed police around central London, they said. Policing will focus on crowded areas with a lot of footfall where an attacker could do most damage. Aside from the guns strapped to their chest, both officers also carried Glock pistols, Taser stun guns, CS spray and batons. Updated at 9.18am BST  8.36am BST Amateur film maker Stuart Kenny witnessed the incident (seemingly from a hotel window) I think there's been an incident outside the Imperial Hotel on Russell Square in London. :( #London pic.twitter.com/t0plUsWM1p Just to clarify folks, I didn't see anything. Me and my Dad heard screams, we thought it was kids mucking around, until we looked outside.  8.27am BST A number of the cordons around the scene of the attack have now been lifted: Detectives continue to investigate incident in #RussellSquare most cordons have now been lifted.

Two remain in hospital. Two people who were injured in the #RussellSquare incident remain in hospital. Three others have been discharged. Further update to follow  8.17am BST The Metropolitan police have put out a renewed call for witnesses: We continue to appeal for witnesses following the incident in #RussellSquare anyone with any info is asked to contact 020 8721 4868  8.04am BST Pol O Geibheannaigh told Sky News: I was approaching the [Night and Day] bar coming back from the cinema about 11.15pm. Close to the corner of Russell Square, the first thing I saw was an armed policeman and I looked down the street and it was just wall to wall police and police vans. Then about 100m from the corner of the square there was a body covered in a red blanket with dark matter around it which I assumed to be blood and more police arrived more police, no ambulances. At the time it was intense, really intense. There was no ambulance there. I counted the vans, there were 20 to 30 vans. I was looking for the ambulance, there was no ambulance.  Then I found out from the bar staff that a woman had been fatally wounded. Then when police came into the bar to interview people, they said a woman had been wounded. There were others they were taking off up to Bedford Square.  He said the incident brought memories of 7/7 flooding back - as the bus that had been blown up in that terrorist attack had been just up the road.   7.43am BST John McDonnell, Labours shadow chancellor, has been speaking to Sky News. He says he supports the increased police presence on the streets of London. The Met has said that more officers, including armed officers, will patrol the capital today.  7.36am BST Russell Square remains cordoned off by police this morning. Phillipa Bagley is visiting London and was staying at the President hotel last night: The bar of the President comes out on to the square. I just came down for a cigarette and saw there was a man with a motorbike helmet balanced on his head walking up and down, then the police came. There was about six or seven people standing around. I thought there had been an accident, I had no idea anyone had been stabbed. I found out this morning. I was shocked. We just came to London for a couple of days for my birthday. I didnt think about anything like this, Im not a great worrier. On second thoughts, in the future  Updated at 7.38am BST  7.07am BST  Early indications suggest mental health is a significant factor in this case and that is one major line of inquiry. But of course at this stage we should keep an open mind regarding motive and consequently terrorism as a motivation remains but one line of inquiry for us to explore.  6.57am BST The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, says police are doing an incredibly difficult job and the safety of Londoners is his number one priority. He says police officers have spoken to the suspect, who was arrested at the scene and is in hospital. I have spoken with the commissioner, and the assistant commissioner, who have assured me that our police officers are working extremely hard to investigate exactly what has happened and to keep the rest of us safe. A man was arrested at the scene. Police have spoken to him and are seeking to establish the full facts including motives for this attack. I urge all Londoners to remain calm and vigilant. Please report anything suspicious to the police. We all have a vital role to play as eyes and ears for our police and security services and in helping to ensure London is protected. Khan says his heart goes out to the victims of the incident in Russell Square and their loved ones.  6.54am BST Forensic tent at the spot in London's Russell Square where woman stabbed to death and others injured in knife attack pic.twitter.com/gSTvyocl6s  6.49am BST Khan added that his heart goes out to the victims of the incident in Russell Square and their loved ones. One woman died, and five other people were injured in the stabbing.  6.37am BST The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has urged Londoners to remain calm and vigilant. The Metropolitan police has said there will be an increased police presence, including armed officers, on the streets of the capital today.  6.30am BST As the day begins, Russell Square remains quiet, Press Association reports: A heavy police presence and cordon remained in place on Thursday morning, with a forensics tent marking the spot where the woman was killed.  A private ambulance was seen removing the body at around 5.20am, after forensics officers had finished scouring the scene for evidence.  Businesses surrounding Russell Square remained closed, with normally busy coffee shops shut to customers as the investigations continued.  6.05am BST A London Ambulance Service spokesperson said: We were called at 10.33pm last night to an incident in Russell Square, WC1. We sent a number of staff to the scene, including four ambulance crews, a responder in a car, an advanced paramedic and two officers. A medical team of a doctor and paramedic from Londons air ambulance also attended by car. Our first staff arrived at the scene within seven minutes. Sadly, despite extensive treatment one woman was pronounced dead at the scene. Our staff also treated a further five people who had been injured during the incident, three men and two women, who were all taken to hospital.  5.50am BST  5.26am BST Extra police patrols will be on Londons streets on Thursday morning following the knife attack. These will include armed officers, with the extra patrols meant to reassure the public, but also visibly demonstrating to the Mets political bosses they can deal with the challenges terrorism  which is not a confirmed motive in the Russell Square attack  presents. Assistant commissioner Mark Rowley said: As a precautionary measure, Londoners will wake up this morning to notice an increased presence on the streets of officers, including armed officers today. We would urge the public to remain calm, alert and vigilant. The UKs terrorism threat level remains at severe, meaning an attack is highly likely.  5.18am BST Here is video of Mark Rowley, assistant commissioner in the Metropolitan police, giving his earlier statement on the stabbing, the victims and the 19-year-old who remains under arrest in hospital: RAW VIDEO: 1 dead and 5 other injured in London knife attack. https://t.co/NafAUnovtU  5.06am BST A new statement from the Metropolitan police now says that two women and three men (and not one woman and four men, as earlier reported) were the five people injured in the attack. This is in addition to the woman who died at the scene. The statement gives no further information on their injuries.  4.49am BST Although police say terrorism is just one possible line of enquiry in the Russell Square attack, its comes amid heightened fear of a terrorist attack in the UK. On Sunday, Britains most senior police officer, Met commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, said an attack was a matter of when not if. UK security officials have watched in alarm as France has suffered repeated attacks, as well as Germany, and believe a similar incident in the UK is verging on inevitable. Since August 2014 the UK terrorist threat level has been raised to its second highest level of severe. The government said the heightened alert was related to developments in Syria and Iraq, where terrorist groups are planning attacks against the west  a reference to Isis.  4.35am BST The Met made knife crime a focus earlier this year, when it released statistics that showed it had been called to more than 9,000 stabbing-related incidents in London in the year ending April 2016. More than 1,620 victims were under the age of 25, including 866 teenagers. Twelve victims had been killed. The release coincided with the launch of its campaign video, Choose a life not a knife. At the time, London mayor Sadiq Khan told the BBC he was extremely worried: Weve got to make sure that we try and prevent young people from carrying knives in the first place. Every time a young person carries a knife is a sign of failure. He said the Met police commissioner agreed with him that tackling knife crime must be one of our top priorities. Annual crime figures published in April showed that knife crime rose by 9% in England and Wales in 2015.  4.21am BST At present, we have very few details about the suspect or the victims. The woman who died was in her 60s, police said. Of the five people who were injured, one is female and four are male. There is no confirmation of the severity of their injuries. The man who was arrested is 19 years old. He is in police custody in hospital, having been Tasered by an officer at the scene of the knife attack. No names have been released by investigators.  4.04am BST Mark Rowley, who gave the latest police statement (see below), is Britains most senior counter-terrorism officer. He serves as an assistant commissioner in the Metropolitan police and leads its specialist operations division, which is the home for the counter-terrorism command. What leads police to consider terrorism as a possibility is not publicly being discussed. Police in the UK tend to be less open than, say, their counterparts in the United States. In the past, police have classed incidents in the UK as terrorist because of what was said by a suspect at the scene, or because of material recovered from a suspects phone or computer, or because the suspect was known to them as potentially associated with violent extremism. The definition of terrorism in England and Wales is contained in section one of the Terrorism Act of 2000. It is the use of violence to advance a political, ideological or religious cause.  3.59am BST Police were called just after 10.30pm last night [Wednesday] to reports of a man armed with a knife assaulting people at at Russell Square, Camden. Armed officers arrived at the scene within five minutes. They discharged the Taser while confronting and arresting the suspect. Six people have been injured, including the one woman who sadly died at the scene and the others have received various injuries. The deceased woman is in her 60s but it would be inappropriate at this time for me to give any more personal details about her. A 19-year-old man was arrested shortly after 10.39pm and is currently in police custody at hospital. Early indications suggest mental health is a significant factor in this case and that is one major line of inquiry. But of course at this stage we should keep an open mind regarding motive and consequently terrorism as a motivation remains but one line of inquiry for us to explore. At present the Mets homicide command are investigating the incident but at present are supported by our counterterrorism unit. As a precautionary measure tomorrow, Londoners will wake up and in the morning they will notice an increased police presence on the streets, including armed officers. This is there to provide reassurance and safety. We ask the public to remain calm and vigilant and alert.  3.48am BST The woman who died was in her 60s, police said, giving no further information. Five people  one woman and four men  have received various injuries. Armed officers were at the scene within five minutes of being alerted to the attack, when they Tasered and arrested the suspect. Homicide officers are currently leading the investigation, supported by counter-terrorism officers. There will be an increased police presence from Thursday morning on the streets of London, for reassurance and safety, police said.  3.46am BST We have just had an update from the police. A 19-year-old man was Tasered by officers and is in custody in hospital. Police say: Mental health is a significant factor in this case. But they are keeping an open mind regarding motive: Terrorism remains one line of inquiry for us to explore.  3.42am BST My colleague Richard Barnes is at Russell Square and sends this update. It is currently 3.40am in London: Just after 2am at the opposite end of Bedford Place, which runs away from the south side of Russell Square, a police officer was stopping people entering the road, which was cordoned off with police tape. Pointing up towards the square he said seven people had been stabbed, and that the suspect had been caught just behind him  where two forensic team officers in protective suits were going about their work  and was now in custody. He was unable to give any more information either about the victims, the suspect, or what the motive might have been. At about 2.30am the police were just closing off the east side of Russell Square at Southampton Row, quite a busy main road. The south side of the square was already closed off with police in vehicles at both ends. Bedford Place was also closed although they appeared to be letting residents in and out.  3.37am BST We are expecting a statement from police shortly. Vikram Dodd, the Guardians police and crime correspondent, reports that counter-terrorism officers are now involved in the investigation: Scotland Yards counter terrorism command, known as SO15, are involved in the investigation. At first officers from the local borough responded and made the arrest following the detention of the suspect. But as detail emerged, the decision was made to have the counter-terrorism command involved in the investigation. In a sign of the seriousness with which the incident was being treated by the Met, senior officers had been called into work, including chiefs in the Mets counter terrorism command. A new statement is expected from police, after a first giving only sparse details.  3.33am BST A mass stabbing in central London has left one woman dead and up to six people wounded after a man with a knife attacked people in Russell Square. Police said the attack took place at around 10.30pm on Wednesday night. The woman was treated at the scene but pronounced dead a short time later. A man has been arrested. Metropolitan police are expected to hold a press conference shortly, but said that terrorism was one possibility being explored. Well have more details as they come to light."

And no, it isnt Edvard Munch. Its Nikolai Astrup  a legend in his own land, but barely known outside of it. In fact, the Dulwich Picture Gallery, in London, is putting on the first significant show of Astrups work outside Norway in the new year. Will it make him as famous as Munch, his contemporary? It seems suspiciously as if the world only has room for one great Norwegian artist. Astrup was born in 1880 and died in 1928, while Munch was born in 1863 and died in 1944. It is impossible to avoid comparing the two, because both are expressionists who take the real world and transfigure it in blazing, lurid colours. They even have a favourite theme in common: the strange light of summer evenings, when the warmth of the far north makes everything look like a fairytale or a hyper-lucid dream. Astrups paintings of people dancing wildly around midsummer bonfires have a lot in common with Munchs Frieze of Life series. But there is one big difference: Astrup is so much brighter  not just in colour, but also in mood. Just because he is Nordic does not mean he is noir. In fact, this artist  whose style has a rough-hewn, woodcut-like quality (as, of course, do his woodcuts)  is not very modern at all. He is a traditional landscape artist with a veneer of expressionist distortion. His true appeal is that he captures the drama, both sublime and pastoral, of the Norwegian landscape. The gentleness of Astrups vision  his love of nature and idyllic images of rural life  is surely what makes him so loved in Norway. But he is now another building block to broaden knowledge about Scandinavian art outside Scandinavia. This exhibition follows on from a fascinating show at the National Gallery last winter of the 19th-century Norwegian landscape painter Peder Balke. Astrup shows that Balkes romanticism was very much alive in 20th-century Norway. Other rediscoveries of Scandinavian artists by British galleries have included two Danish painters: Christen Kbke and Vilhelm Hammershi. They are all intriguing, but the only one of these finds  Balke, Kbke and Hammershi  who has entered the British public imagination is Hammershi. He is eerie, melancholy and disturbing  in other words, everything we expect from a Nordic artist. Just as we like our Scandinavian cop shows dark, we like our Scandinavian art to be intense and visionary. Astrup is probably too happy an artist ever to satisfy that craving. Hes great, but he wont replace The Bridge."

My kids dont use [the word] and I dont think theyve even heard it because theyve lived in Texas for so long.

The Russian tricolour is flying over the capital. Citizens must decide whether they will collaborate with the occupation, or resist. The scenario of Occupied, a Scandinavian thriller that premieres in Norway this weekend (Sunday 4 October), and in western Europe during the autumn, is likely to tap into fears of Russian aggression  and perhaps, according to critics, inflame them.  Based on an idea by the bestselling Norwegian crime writer Jo Nesb, the series imagines that an environmentalist government has come to power in Norway and ceased to supply Europe with North Sea oil, forcing the EU to call on Russia to come to its aid.  This is a big-budget production with backing from Arte, the Franco-German TV network, and produced by the Swedish studio behind the Wallander TV series and the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo movies.  Russia has condemned the series for pitting Scandinavians against Russians in the worst traditions of the cold war. Although its creators claim that it is obviously fiction, the global context has been upended since Occupied was originally conceived  Russias occupation of Crimea last year and the civil war in east Ukraine have fuelled the worst crisis in relations with Moscow for a generation.  When I presented this idea about two years ago, they said the problem is its a bit far-fetched, Nesb told the Guardian this year. But events in Ukraine have proved him right, he believes.   Related: Jo Nesb interview: 'The thing about Scandinavia is that we take things for granted. Things can change very fast'  Marianne Gray, the series producer, said:The timing is insane given what is happening in the world. For many in the Nordic countries, the possibility of Russian aggression seems an all too clear and present danger. Governments are ramping up their military spending in step with their rhetoric.  Swedens military has been instructed to call up thousands of reservists for refresher training to increase the operational effectiveness of our units in response to the changing security situation in Europe, said Maj Gen Karl Engelbrektson, an army spokesman. Swedens home guard, which mobilises some 22,000 volunteer reservists, says it has seen a large increase in people wanting to join since the Ukraine-Russia conflict broke out. Earlier this year, Swedens government declared it was returning troops to the strategic Baltic territory of Gotland amid suspicions that Russia had conducted war games to seize Swedish, Danish and Finnish islands. The Swedish defence minister, Peter Hultqvist, announced an inquiry this autumn into reintroducing conscription, a move he himself favours and which is popular in the polls.  Urban Lindstrm, whose Facebook campaign to bring back conscription last month surpassed 10,000 followers, said: It is imperative that not only the professional army, but also the home guard receives soldiers with adequate training  we can only achieve that with a sufficient number of conscripts every year.   Opinion surveys suggest a new and growing plurality in favour of joining Nato  insurance against occupation, as some politicians call it. According to a poll in September, 41% of Swedes were in favour of Nato membership  up 10 percentage points since May  and 39% against.  Until recently, Finland was emphatically opposed to Nato membership, but its new rightwing government said in May it reserved the option to apply for membership at any time and was calculating the potential costs and implications.  Hannah Smith, a specialist in Russia at Helsinki University, and a supporter of Nato membership, said: Since the beginning of 2014 the average voters concern about Russia has increased massively. A lot of the younger generation has been infected by the older generations suspiciousness. Suspicions about Moscows intentions towards Denmark have been fuelled by incursions into Danish airspace, with fighters scrambled 58 times in 2014 to intercept Russian aircraft. Denmarks military intelligence alleges that In June 2014, Russia mounted a dummy attack on the Danish island of Bornholm while the countrys political elite were gathered there. The choice of the Danish title  The Russian Ambassador  for Norways new TV series carries a particular resonance given the furore this year caused by Mikhail Vanin, Russias ambassador to Copenhagen, when he told a newspaper that Danish warships would be targets for Russian nuclear missiles, if the country chose to join Natos missile shield. The series airs in Denmark next week. Vanin said: History shows that aggression has always originated from the west of Europe. It is sufficient to recall the Teutonic Knights, Swedish expansion, Napoleon or Hitler. Do not forget about their modern successor  Nato. In this context, we have no positive sentiments about the forthcoming premiere of Occupied. Oslos relations with Russia have also turned frosty. In September, Norway unveiled the first of up to 52 F-35 fighter jets it is purchasing from the US, saying the stealth aircraft provide an important counterweight to Russia in the region. Announcing a boost to military spending, the defence minister Ine Marie Eriksen Sreide said: Russia has shown both the ability and willingness to use military force to achieve its strategic objectives. Public opinion has also shifted. An opinion survey of 41 countries by Gallup last year found that Norwegians topped the poll as the most negatively disposed towards the Russian leadership, with 89% disapproving.  In Norway many people used to be moderately positive towards Russia, but the developments in Ukraine have driven a big shift, said Indra verland, a professor at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs. Some of those who were neutral have turned negative, and the negatives have gone super-negative. How will the new fictionalised TV version of Russian occupation play among the Scandinavian public? Lots of people will watch it, but it is more an expression of what has changed rather than something that will influence opinion, Prof verland said. When Geir Pollen, a lecturer in Norwegian at St Petersburg State University, wrote an article condemning the series for resurrecting cold war stereotypes, some of his Russian students wrote him letters of thanks.  When I see how much they love Norwegian and work on the language and are so dedicated, but then we give them such rubbish, I am very much ashamed, Pollen said. The series contributes to a black and white picture of the Russians. It is very irresponsible. Occupied will show on Sky Arts in the UK early in 2016. The series airs in Germany, France, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, the Netherlands and Belgium this autumn and in the new year."

We are hiding it under the carpet and I dont think we have learned anything from it, the writer told the Edinburgh international book festival. To some extent it wants to forget about it, she said of Norways reaction to the horror. It doesnt want to deal with what happened. Seierstad, a foreign correspondent in Russia, China, Kosovo and Afghanistan before she turned her attention to the shattering events in Oslo and on Utya, painstakingly researched Breiviks life and the events leading up to the massacre for her book One of Us: the Story of Anders Breivik and the Massacre in Norway. She also researched the lives of those who had been murdered, talking at length to the families of the dead, keen to represent them as not just victims being hunted. Though the events she was describing were as terrible as it gets, it had been rewarding, she said, to meet the parents and learn about the lives of the young people who had been attending the Labour partys summer youth camp. The family members were given the right of veto over Seierstads manuscript; none of them exerted it and royalties from the book are to be donated to charities of the families choosing. The inadequate and slow police response to reports of the killings had been particularly notable, she said: It wasnt just one person who didnt do his job but 35 or 40, she said. There had been what she called a wait-and-see attitude  but for every minute wasted, another life had been lost. Security measures had not been much altered in Norway as a response to the tragedy, she said  politicians deciding that to increase security for obvious targets of terrorism would increase the risk for softer targets such as schools and kindergartens. Seierstad, whose previous book was the bestselling The Bookseller of Kabul, also said that Breivik had much in common with Islamic State. He was building a new state in his head, she said. His fantasy Europe was white and Christian, in which apostates would be killed, or in certain cases forced to pay special taxes: a kind of reverse image of Isiss vision. And yet the violent anti-Islamic rhetoric that he espoused was not the most important motivation for the killings, she had concluded. After examining Breiviks life in detail  including speaking to his mother days before she died from cancer  she found a childhood that a child shouldnt have. Breivik was the son of a dysfunctional marriage that, when it ended, left him alone with his troubled mother, who had probably been the victim of childhood abuse. At the age of four, the child had already been monitored by social services, and his inability to smile, play or connect with other people noted. His mother ricocheted between signs of hatred for her son  telling him she wished he had never been born  and displays of affection. Love hate, love hate: the worst thing you can do to a child, said Seierstad. Having been denied the opportunity to form relationships with his parents, he then struggled to relate to other children. A pattern was formed in which Breivik attempted to befriend, or failing that, impress, peers: first schoolmates, then contacts made online through games such as World of Warcraft; and later those he met on the web via rightwing and anti-Islamic groups. If you are not loved you want to be admired; if you are not admired you want to be feared, in the end, said Seierstad. Having failed to connect with the people around him, he also failed to connect with wider society: His hatred for society, for social democracy and Norway came so much earlier than his anti-Muslim and anti-immigration ideas, she said, although these thoughts had formed the basis of a series of texts, distributed electronically on the day of the massacre, setting forth his views. Seierstad said that she had believed Breivik to be gay for some time, but at length rejected the idea. He was not afraid of women  just afraid. He was afraid of getting close to people and being unmasked, she said. His attempts to show off to those he encountered and attempted to befriend were rebuffed. Even when he forayed to the darker sides of the internet  sites where conspiracy theories and fantasies about Muslims taking Europe were shared he was rejected. Not because he was so weird, but because he was so boring, said Seierstad. She said that she believed that Breivik was not in fact truly committed to the anti-Islamic rhetoric he espoused. He was never racist, she said, but it was among the far right that he met his crew of hatred."

The Trolltunga, as it<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>s known in Norwegian, is a spit of rock jutting out from a sheer face, about 700m above Ringedal lake in the Hardangerfjord region of south-west Norway, and the photo has become a tourist must-do over the past few years.

The Trolltunga, as its known in Norwegian, is a spit of rock jutting out from a sheer face, about 700m above Ringedal lake in the Hardangerfjord region of south-west Norway, and the photo has become a tourist must-do over the past few years. Its not the simplest of snaps to bag though: it involves a 22km circular hike from the starting point at the activity centre down in the valley at Skjeggedal. This is my third hike in as many days, and I can feel my leg muscles protesting  a rest day might have been a good idea. But touring the Big Three of western Norway  Kjerag, Preikestolen (Pulpit Rock) and Trolltunga  is irresistible. The wonderful scenery combined with dramatic rock formations at each location make these three among the most popular trails in the country, plus the photo ops and bragability factor of standing out on these seemingly precarious rocks is a great draw. The fjord region in particular gets most footfall because of the excellent infrastructure, with well-marked paths and cabins for overnight stays. And now an express bus route has linked these three hikes. Previously they were only reachable by car, but the bus  with tickets from 490 NOK (39, bookable at tide.no, no cash taken on the buses)  makes this notoriously expensive country much more accessible. Plus theres budget accommodation at each stop, so the whole five-day trip costs me under 500, including flights and breakfasts. Packed lunches can be made from the breakfast spread for a small fee at most huts and hotels, and 15 is about the average cost of an evening meal. Alcohol is still a sticking point  if you want to do Norway cheaply, go teetotal, or decant a bottle of duty-free hooch into a plastic trekking bottle. The bus runs through the summer season. In the Stavanger region, where Kjerag and Preikestolen are found, it runs from June to the end of August and to Trolltunga in the Hardanger region, from July to August. I visit as soon as the bus route to Trolltunga opens at the beginning of July. The snow should have disappeared a month ago, but it has been a long winter, and our small guided group, booked through Trolltunga Active (eight-hour guided walk 43pp, trolltunga-active.com), has to negotiate the snowy path quite slowly. We reach our destination after five-and-a-half hours, shovelling down our packed lunches while taking in the views across the fjord. Its a gloriously sunny day, and the mainly young crowd creates something akin to a festival atmosphere while we queue to get that shot on the tongue. When I peer breathlessly over the precipice, Daniel, our guide, tells me: These hikes provide some of the most spectacular views of Norways natural wonders. They are not just sightseeing trips, but real challenges. You feel like you have really earned the thrill of standing on the edge.  Related: Norway's amazing hiking cabins  My trip had begun three days earlier in the pretty harbour town of Stavanger, where I stayed the night before making the three-hour bus journey to ygardstl, for the first hike to Kjerag boulder, a tough five-hour walk including an ascent of a sheer rock face using metal rungs that ended in a gale force wind hitting me like a smack in the face on the cliff top. Sunglasses, hats, loose clothing and anything that isnt fastened down is whipped off and flung over the side of the cliff, as if some mischievous invisible troll is having fun. Without the late snow, the Kjerag boulder can be enjoyed in its full-suspended glory, wedged miraculously between two cliff faces, for the more intrepid to walk out on to. But with the buffeting wind and snowy conditions, I thought better of it and enjoyed instead the spectacular waterfall, mighty with snowmelt, cascading into Lysefjord, 1,000m below. I celebrated afterwards with a beer at the ygardst hut at the bottom but, because its not possible to stay overnight here, I took a (free) shuttle bus down to the Lysebotn mountain accommodation on the fjord shore. These cabins are part of an impressive network of more than 500 across the country, run by the Norwegian Trekking Association, and consist of small, neat chalet blocks around a common room and dining area. A dorm bed costs 25 a night, including breakfast. At dinner, I sat on the small veranda to watch the sun not set, with my warming bowl of hippie vegan stew and chatted to hikers from as far afield as Malaysia and the US, all here for the natural wonders. A ferry takes hikers to the next challenge, through the dramatic Lysefjord, to Forsand, where a bus (22 return) runs up to the Preikestolen mountain hut for the starting point of the second trail. This hut couldnt be less of a hut. It is a magnificent Scandi-modern building, with hotel-standard rooms, fjord views and dorm beds again for 25. Meals are served on giant slate tables in front of the hut and feature five courses of dishes such as tomato soup with egg, poached salmon, pork neck and salads, then home-baked cakes.  Related: Oslo on a budget  from wild camping to city highlights for less  The second walk, from here to Pulpit Rock, is by far the easiest of the three, with toddlers and elderly people among those enjoying the two-hour trek up to a large flat shelf of granite projecting out over the fjord. We are lower here (604m) than at Kjerag so the snow is not a problem, in fact, there are large freshwater pools connected by streams that are warm enough to swim in at this time of year, and I happily plunge in for a cooling dip on my way back down. It was then a five-hour bus ride up to Odda for the Trolltunga hike, but the journey flew by while I gawped at a landscape peppered with spectacular waterfalls, which has earned this route the moniker of most beautiful bus route in Norway. The basic Trolltunga Hotel was my base in Odda, convenient for the shuttle service ferrying hikers up to the start of the trail in the morning. Such organisation and reliable services make a short hiking trip to revel in the majesty of the three rock stars of Norway so easy ... the only thing to worry about is the aching muscles at the end of it."

Norway had so much possession, so many chances but could only score when 3-0 down on aggregate. This was poor viewing for the neutral but the Magic Magyars are back in a tournament for the first time in 30 years and they are dancing jubilantly on the pitch. Well see them in France in June. Norways players can book their couple of weeks in the sun. Thanks for reading. Bye! Updated at 9.37pm GMT  9.34pm GMT 90 min +2: Bode is offside and, already on a booking, kicks the ball away to kill a few more seconds. Lucky not to be sent off, there.  9.33pm GMT 90 min: There will be three minutes added on. Three minutes that wont seem too long when Hungary have been waiting 30 years for some success. Updated at 9.33pm GMT  9.32pm GMT 90 min: Helland shoots acrobatically from the edge of the area. It trickles out for a goal-kick and that should snap Norways final straw.  9.31pm GMT 89 min: Helland has a pop from range. Kiraly smothers it. Hungary need to hold their bottle.  9.30pm GMT 87 min: And with the game beyond their reach Norway finally score! Berget is denied by Kiraly but Henriksen is on hand to convert the rebound, the ball nestling in the bottom right corner.  9.26pm GMT 83 min: The 30-year wait is over! Dzsudzsak sends in a corner Bode flicks it on at the near post and it looks like Henriksen deflects the ball into his own net with no time to react. Hungary are on their way to France. Norways players can have the summer off. Updated at 9.35pm GMT  9.24pm GMT 80 min: Bode is booked for a ludicrous wrestling tackle on Hovland. And Berget is on for Norway, in the place of Skjelbred.  9.22pm GMT 79 min: Another Norway chance  and again it fails to find the target. Johansens curling attempt is a few inches too high.  9.19pm GMT 76 min: A chance for Norway: Pedersen, after a Tettey attempt is not cleared, shoots low but is denied by the diving Kiraly.  9.18pm GMT 75 min: Hungarys final substitution sees Nemeth replaced the hard-working Kleinheisler.  9.14pm GMT 72 min: And still Hungary look more dangerous. Dzsudzsak evades Allesami and his low drive is well saved by Nylland. Updated at 9.16pm GMT  9.13pm GMT 70 min: The 24th corner is cleared. The 25th is delivered by Helland. Its half-cleared to Skjelbred, whose shot is blocked and eventually Hungary get fully rid.  9.11pm GMT 23 corners now for Norway over the two legs. No goals.  9.08pm GMT 66 min: Hungary attack again. Lovrenscics shoots from a tough angle but can only find the side-netting.  9.07pm GMT 64 min: A rare Hungarian attack in this half sees Lovrenscics cross from the left after Kleinheislers decent through ball. Bode rises to meet the delivery but is called up for a foul on Hovland.  9.05pm GMT 63 min: Second change for the hosts sees the goalscorer, Priskin, replaced by Bode  although the announcer in the stadium has got it the wrong way round. Chuckle, my pedantic friends, chuckle!  9.04pm GMT 61 min: Helland crosses from the right and Henriksen rises above Kadar but the Norwegians attempt is headed away for a corner. Helland delivers and Pedersen is whistle up incorrectly for a foul on Kiraly, who had actually dived for the cross but missed it completely.  9.02pm GMT 60 min: Forren sends a pass that is more hopeless than hopeful forward. Norway are now resorting to punts forward.  9.01pm GMT 57 min: Norway passing it back and forth but there are red shirts in front of them. When they inevitably lose possession, Hungary break again and the captain, Dzsudzsak has a go from a tightish angle on the right of the box after cutting in on his left. It takes a deflection and loops onto the bar. That was close to sealing it, though its a struggle to figure out where Norway will score once, nevermind twice.  8.59pm GMT Seeing as the game is poor, lets stare at wonder at this! Evolution of the European Championship football #EURO2016 #ADIDAS pic.twitter.com/yTE3Snk2Nk  8.57pm GMT 55 min: Helland puts in another free-kick! His fourth set-piece since coming on nine minutes ago! This one is poor and Kiraly collects. At least there is a really good atmosphere to enjoy, because the football is poor  and thats being kind.  8.55pm GMT 53 min: Forren makes a fine but tough tackle on Priskin as Hungary attempt to break. Thats the first thing Norway have done that deserves credit so far. Updated at 9.01pm GMT  8.54pm GMT 51 min: Norway win another free-kick. Helland takes once more, but from the left on this occasion. It bounces unchallenged in the area. Nobody gets on it and Kiraly saves. Thats awful from both sides  nobody there to defend a dangerous cross but no attacker on hand to even attempt to convert it.  8.51pm GMT 48 min: Norways formation appears to remain the same despite those changes, with Henriksen the lone frontman. Helland delivers from a free-kick on the right. Three white shirts try to get on the end of it but none can connect and Hungary have a goal-kick.  8.49pm GMT 47 min: Hellands first act is to deliver a corner. Its hit long and Tettey heads wide at the rear stick.  8.48pm GMT 46 min: We are underway again. What can Norway do? Changes are certainly what the doctor ordered considering how short they were of ideas in attack. Updated at 8.49pm GMT  8.47pm GMT One change for Hungary  Pinter on for Elek. And two changes for Norway  Pedersen on for Elyounoussi and Helland on for Odegaard, who still looks out of his depth at international level.  8.33pm GMT Priskins early goal  a stunner following a counter-attack  has Hungary with one foot in next summers tournament. Norway remain short on ideas up front and really need to improve quick. Updated at 8.46pm GMT  8.31pm GMT 45 min: There will be one minute added on. Norway are pushing a little more  the break is coming at the wrong time for them.  8.31pm GMT 44 min: Norway go close! They win a corner. Another ball is crossed in by Odegaard and Hovland rises and connects well but is denied by Kiralys right-hand post.   8.29pm GMT 43 min: Another Norway cross. Elyounoussi delivers from the left after Allesami fed him. Its too long for Odegaard and the ball trickles out harmlessly for a goal-kick.  8.27pm GMT 42 min: Priskin, still running hard after that dreamy goal, fouls Allesami near Norways endline.  8.26pm GMT 40 min: And that means Norways only real threat comes from crosses. Elabdellaoui sends one in from the right, Guzmics puts it out for a corner. Hungary clear and break. The counter ends up with Priskin but Elabdellaoui gets across to block just as he shot from about eight yards. Updated at 8.52pm GMT  8.24pm GMT 37 min: Allesami tries to cross from deep on the left but sends the ball into the stands. Dismal. Norway have had one attempt on goal, Hungary have had four on target. The visitors lack someone capable of picking out a defence-splitting pass. They also dont have anybody capable of running directly.  8.22pm GMT 35 min: Norway have had almost 70% of the ball but Hungary still look more likely to score. Kleinheisler sends a teasing cross in from the right and Lovrenscics arrives at the backpost but heads narrowly wide.   8.19pm GMT 33 min: Dzsudzsak ambitiously attempts to catch out Nylland by shooting from a free-kick wide on the right but it bounces once before the Norway keeper makes a simple collection.  8.16pm GMT 30 min: Hungary pass it across the back to a chorus of oles from the home support but a dawdling Fiola is closed down by Johansen and ends up kicking the ball out for a throw-in under pressure.  8.14pm GMT 27 min: And they create a decent chance! Allesami has an attempt blocked before Elyounoussis rebound is saved well by Kiraly, who gets down low. Odegaard takes the ensuing corner and Henriksen cannot direct his header towards goal.  8.12pm GMT 26 min: Hungary are by no means an impressive side but Norway really are a limited outfit  perhaps illustrated by playing a 16-year-old in midfield. Updated at 8.30pm GMT  8.11pm GMT 25 min: Norway are playing in what Pep Guardiola calls the ineffective U  attempting to work it down one flank, finding no way through before going back and trying their luck on the other wing. Before going back again until they eventually run into trouble and squander control of the ball.  8.09pm GMT 22 min: Hungary are also working hard to press Norway in possession and when Kelinheisler dispossess Skjelbred, the Norway captain cynically and frustratedly commits a foul on halfway.  8.07pm GMT 20 min: Skjelbred is fouled by Kadar just inside the Hungary half on the right. But Norway continue to find very little space to squeeze through in attack. Odegaard, born eight years after the last time Hungary were in a major tournament, has been anonymous thus far.  8.04pm GMT 18 min: Hungary are now on top since the goal, probing for the goal that will end Norways challenge. Dzsudzsak does some dancing before a shot from around 25 yards is blocked by Forren.  8.02pm GMT 15 min: That also means no extra-time! But, obviously, Norway still only need two goals to progress.  8.00pm GMT 14 min: Wow! A long ball is played forward by Kadar to Priskin on the left channel. He turns Forren before rifling a stunning effort home from just inside the area, leaving Nylland with no chance. Are Hungary back in the big time? Updated at 8.18pm GMT  7.59pm GMT 12 min: Kleinheisler picks up possession in midfield and tries to play in Priskin, but Hungarys lone striker is offside.  7.58pm GMT 10 min: Another cross on the left, this time from Allesami, is more threatening but Hungary defend well again and Dzsudzsak is allowed to break. Johansen is across to stop him quickly  sliding in and picking up a yellow card for a foul. The Hungary captain rolls half a dozen times before immediately picking himself up once he noticed the referee, Senor Velasco Carballo reaching for his pocket.  7.55pm GMT 9 min: Henriksen crosses deep from the left but it troubles nobody and Lang heads it calmly back to Kiraly.  7.54pm GMT 7 min: It sounds like there is an amazing atmosphere in Budapest though! Norway are presently enjoying plenty of the ball in their own half but are struggling to find a way past Hungary, lined up in a compact 4-2-3-1.  7.51pm GMT 3 min: Hungary, having had such little of the ball in the first leg, will have to do a lot of defending again this evening. Gabor Kiraly, in goal for the hosts, is wearing trackies of course.  7.48pm GMT 1 min: Promising start for the hosts. Dzsudzsak has a shot from range that is saved by Nylland. The Hungary captain then wins a corner that is taken short to Kleinheisler  Norway clear at their near post.  7.46pm GMT 1 min: Norway, in white with navy shorts, kick-off to a deafening chorus of boos. Hungary are in red with white shorts.  7.45pm GMT We will now have a minute of applause in memory of those who lost their lives in the terrorist attacks in Paris on Friday night, plus recently deceased former players Marton Fulop and Pal Varhidi. Updated at 7.57pm GMT  7.42pm GMT Im watching this on Hungarian TV due to a problem with our office box here in London. Unusually, the pundits and presenter are wearing the Hungarian kit! Can you imagine Pougatch, Dixon, Wright and friends sat in the studio with the three lions on their shirt? Actually, you probably can imagine Wright.  7.39pm GMT The teams are out and the anthems are imminent.  6.58pm GMT Hungary: Kiraly; Fiola, Guzmics, Lang, Kadar; Elek; Lovrenscics, Kleinheisler, Nagy, Dzsudzsak; Priskin. Subs: Bogdan, Vanczak, Szalai, Bosnjak, Nemeth, Bode, Pinter, Nikolic, Stieber, Leandro, Juhasz, Megyeri.

Amid growing fear among pro-EU Tories that the Leave campaign is making most of the running in the EU debate, Cameron will say he sees little future for Britain alongside European countries that have opted out of the EU. The prime minister, who has faced strong pressure from pro-European Tories to highlight the benefits of the UKs EU membership, will speak out during an appearance at the Northern Future Forum in Reykjavik, Iceland. He will use the chance of a summit in a European capital outside the EU to issue a point-by-point challenge to the claim by the Leave campaign that Britain could negotiate a credible relationship with Brussels from outside the EU.  Related: We pay, but have no say: thats the reality of Norways relationship with the EU | Espen Barth Eide  Cameron will focus on the Norwegian option, often cited by the Leave campaign, which has allowed Oslo to enjoy access to the single market without joining the EU. The prime minister believes it is important to highlight the questions Britain would face if it left the EU and followed Norways model, a No 10 source said. Downing Street pointed out that Norway is the 10th largest contributor to the EU budget and is bound by the rules of the single market without any say in the decision-making process. Camerons intervention is a conscious decision to up the tempo on the EU ahead of the first formal roundtable negotiations on Britains demands at the European summit in December. Downing Street had always decided it would adopt a low profile in the run-up to the Polish election last Sunday that resulted in the election of the Tories sister party, the Law and Justice party. Cameron will now engage more actively on two levels. He will embark on a new round of meetings with EU leaders  he hosted Luxembourgs prime minister, Xavier Bettel, in No 10 on Tuesday  before in mid-November laying down in writing his demands to the European council president, Donald Tusk. Cameron will also adopt a less neutral approach as he challenges the claims of the Leave campaign. Downing Street sources said the new tactics do not mean the prime minister has decided that the UK should remain a member of the EU regardless of the outcome of his negotiations. The No 10 source said: The prime ministers plan is to renegotiate the terms of the UKs relationship with the EU  with the aim of staying in a reformed EU. But he rules nothing out if that negotiation is not successful. That is code for saying that Cameron would be prepared to recommend a vote to leave the EU if his negotiations fail. But senior Tories say there is a growing realisation in Downing Street that the prime minister would face a difficult finale to his premiership if the negotiations fail.

Cameron, who will meet the Norwegian prime minister, Erna Solberg, and the Icelandic prime minister, Sigmundur Dav Gunnlaugsson, in Reykjavik, will challenge the Leave campaign to answer five questions if the UK followed the Norwegian option: A Guardian article by the former Norwegian foreign minister, Espen Eide, offers help to Cameron. Eide writes: Those campaigning for Britain to leave the EU and choose the Norwegian way can hence correctly claim that a country can retain access to the single market from outside the EU.  What is normally not said, however, is that this also means retaining all the EUs product standards, financial regulations, employment regulations, and substantial contributions to the EU budget. A Britain choosing this track would, in other words, keep paying, it would be run by Brussels, and it would remain committed to the four freedoms, including free movement.  Related: EU exit: 'Norway option' would leave UK with 94% of current costs  thinktank  Speaking to the BBC, Frans Timmermans, vice-president of the European commission, confirmed that Norway  which is part of the Schengen open-borders agreement  would have to be part of the EUs plan for resettling migrants.  He argued that Britain is already in a position to control its own borders, but indicated it would probably be possible to accommodate the UKs demand for an exemption from ever closer union and greater powers to set domestic VAT rates. The Vote Leave campaign director Dominic Cummings, who used to serve as Michael Goves special adviser, said: Vote Leave does not support the Norway option for Britain. After we vote leave, we will negotiate a new UK-EU deal based on free trade and friendly cooperation. We will end the supremacy of EU law. We will bring back control including over trade deals and migration. This is safer than voting to remain which means giving more power and money to Brussels every year."

England were miserable for the best part of an hour, but Steph Houghtons perfectly cliched captains goal gave them an equaliser, and after that, the combination play of Scott and Taylor, allied to the bite of Chapman, the trickery of Carney and fitness and drive of everyone allowed them to take control. Theyll play Canada on Saturday night for a place in the semi-final, and, given the draw, will fancy themselves for the final. Well!  Updated at 11.59pm BST  11.49pm BST 90+2 min The crowd boo as Scott again burrows to the corner, and were at last chance time - but again, Scott finds he way to the flag and rinses more time. England have been excellent since going behind, and particularly since going ahead; Norway have had almost nowt.   11.47pm BST 90 min There shall be three minutes of stoppage time, as Scott again holds the ball in the corner - theyre not asking who she is anymore.   11.45pm BST 89 min England are perilously close to getting through!   11.44pm BST 88 min This is great from Hegerberg, running away from Scott down the left, cutting in, and crunching a shot from 20 yards just over the top.   11.43pm BST 87 min Wold departs, Utland arrives.   11.43pm BST 87 min Ive only watched the second half, so cant say for certain, emails Andrew Gerrard, but for the first 15 mins Norway were much faster and physical. Rather than the substitutions being the difference, is it possible that Norway are just knackered and England kept more in reserve in the heat? Yes - as I said, Norway look shattered. Also, England have rotated through the competition, so, though you sacrifice cohesion, you get freshness.   11.42pm BST 85 min England looking for the corners now, and when they cant find them, just to keep possession - they look comfortable and composed, Taylor almost happening upon a third when Lund and Thorisdottir gets themselves into a muddle inside their own box.  11.39pm BST 83 min Scott and Taylor haver made a difference, but the changes have also allowed Chapman into an area of the pitch where she can rattle Norways midfield, instead of hoping to get in the way of their attackers.   11.38pm BST 81 min Scott, again winde on the right, crosses into Carney, who lays back for Chapman, accepts the return, and from outside the box, hurries through a snap-shot that has Hjelmseth scurrying to shovel around the post.   11.37pm BST 80 min Ill say it. Theres more chance of a third England goal than a Norway equaliser. I wonder if Sampson will reward the players whove changed the game with a start next time, should England his team win.  11.35pm BST 78 min Norway look absolutely shattered.   11.32pm BST Scott, who always has time on the ball, exchanges passes with Taylor, the kind of composed little move that was beyond England in the first half. Scott then rolls back into the path of Bronze, just outside the box, right corner, and she absolutely annihilates a shot that screeches into the near top corner. WHAT A GOAL!  Updated at 11.45pm BST  11.31pm BST 74 min But theres a warning, Gulbransen curving a ball between Bassett and Bronze - shes a player - and Hegerberg burns by the latter, clattering a shot into Bardsleys fingers. She could do with improving her finishing, and once she does, shell be a serious threat, because her pace is something else.   11.29pm BST 72 min Its not all England, but its certainly significantly England. Theyre pressing higher up the pitch and forcing errors from a side that looks like its tiring.   11.28pm BST 72 min On the subject of Houghtons goal, it probably looks more like this:  11.27pm BST 70 min Thorsnes replaces Minde, and when a long cross eludes Houghton and Bassett, either side of Herlovsen, she stretches into a shot that flies only just over the bar.   11.25pm BST 68 min The ball ricochets around the Norway box as Scott laces over a low cross - Norway arent enjoying this now, but manage to scramble clear.  Updated at 11.26pm BST  11.24pm BST 67 min My friends and I beat Al Murray, Pub Landlord, and his team in a pub quiz earlier this evening, emails Alys Barber-Rogers. Im taking this as an omen either that England will win because Im on a roll or that theyll lose because Ive upset a classic English comic. Im very conflicted. Seems fairly clear that this is shaping up into an archetypal penalty defeat.   11.22pm BST 65 min Carney, who might be better in a central role, turns up in a central position and spreads right to Bronze. She clips a low cross into Taylor, showing early, but she cant quite escape Lund. Still, a promising sign.  11.20pm BST 63 min Taylor replaces Duggan, and suddenly England have momentum. Theres also a stoppage as Chapman clatters Gulbransen.  Updated at 11.29pm BST  11.17pm BST Scott clips the corner towards the penalty spot, and theres Houghton with a captains goal, brilliantly losing her marker to run inside and thud-guide a header into the bottom-right. Its not dissimilar in execution to this: But also minds of this: Updated at 11.50pm BST  11.17pm BST 60 min Williams sends a ball out wide to Scott, alone on the right. No help arrives, so shes forced to win a corner.  11.16pm BST 60 min Minde sends a long ball over the top for Herlovsen, racing between Houghton and Bassett. But it pitches and skips away from her - just.   11.15pm BST 59 min Jodie Taylor looks like shes ready to come on, which might help England - if nothing else, it might encourage them to get the ball into the box, even if the midfield balance still isnt right.   11.13pm BST 57 min England are back to a 4-2-3-1, with Scott on the right, Carney on the left and Chapman in the middle, or, put another way, still no help for Duggan. Its hard not to conclude that Sampson is outsmarting himself here.  Updated at 11.14pm BST  11.11pm BST A Steve Bould special. Mykjaland whips one into the near post, Gulbransen steals in front of Rafferty, and flicks it superbly off her forehead and behind, the ball whizzing in off the bar.  Updated at 11.23pm BST  11.10pm BST 54 min Avant-garde - Scott comes on for Kirby, with England defending a corner, needlessly conceded by Bardsley. That said, shes a lot more use in the circumstance than who shes replaced.  Updated at 11.12pm BST  11.09pm BST 52 min Jill Scott is taking some advice, and looks set to take the long walk to join us. Lets hope she does some good getting in the way.   11.08pm BST 51 min Norway win a corner down the right, Mykjaland over to take it. She sends an outswinger into the middle, and Bardsley, whos been Englands best player, is out to claim well.   11.05pm BST 49 min Williams, whos passing hasnt been great, looks for Duggan down the left. Its not perfect, but the way the ball skips off the turf and away must be a right annoyance.   11.04pm BST 47 min Kirby, infield, sends Carney away down the right - and theres Hegerberg, haring after her like nobodys business, shoulder-charging her off the ball to win the throw.   11.02pm BST 46 min Bronze burrows down the right immediately, Wold eventually stopping her, but thats the kind of positive start they needed to make.   11.02pm BST 46 min England get us off again.   11.01pm BST England dont look like theyre making any changes - slightly odd - while Norway bring Thorisdottir on for Ronning, the captain, presumed injured.  Updated at 11.03pm BST  11.00pm BST Out come the players again...  10.59pm BST Half-time email: It doesnt matter what would improve what, orders Matt Dony. Surely, in the eyes of all right-thinking people, drum and bass/jungle (theyre near enough the same!) died the day Roni Size wandered off with Ok Computers Mercury Prize. New Forms is a great album - granted, not as good, but still good, an exceptional live.   10.47pm BST Not at all good by England. They look like theyve been sent out to combat, rather than assert, and its showing.  Updated at 10.48pm BST  10.47pm BST 45+1 min Kirby, now on the right, forces a mistake out of Mjelde, harrying her down the by-line. But with with the opportunity to shoot, she instead settled for a corner that there may not be time to take. There is, but - its headed clear, and Carney rams a shot over the top.   10.45pm BST 45 min There shall be a single, solitary added minute.   10.45pm BST 45 min Two more corners forced by England, the second drilled flat for Houghton. She times her run and jump well, but her headers blocked, and an infringement or other allows Norway to reset.   10.44pm BST 42 min A suit at a top league club told me that Laura Bassett was an accident waiting to happen, but shes been excellent so far. Again, she stands up well to a long ball looking for Minde, forcing the foul that allows England to clear.   10.41pm BST 40 min Bronze turns a backpass short, and Hegerberg is onto it in a trice, winding up a shot as Bronze leans right into her; if she goes down, its a penalty. But she stays up, welting a effort into Bardsleys midriff, when a more studied finish could have given her no chance.  Updated at 11.04pm BST  10.39pm BST 39 min Talking of techno, I found myself in a discotheque on a boat on the Seine recently - Id forgotten how horrific it is. England have changed to a 4-2-3-1, the specific aim to get Chapman on Mykjaland.  10.38pm BST 38 min Human Traffic is the last word on the national anthem for me, says Tom Longfield. Not quite jungle, but not only does it feature a techno emergency, and its got Danny Dyer in it. Theres also Radiohead  And a favourite Danny Dyer because why not. Updated at 10.38pm BST  10.36pm BST 36 min Duggan is starting to hustle well, and she chases into Ronning, dwelling on a bouncing ball. She cant quite chest it into her path, but these last few minutes have seen England apply a little pressure.   10.35pm BST 35 min England win a free-kick 30 yards out, just right of centre, and Williams steps up to luz it over the bar.   10.34pm BST 33 min Fun fact about Norways Herlovsen, emails Torbjrn O. Karlsen Her father was a Norway international and used to play professionally for Borussia Mnchengladbach in the Bundesliga. Anyone else out there on the artificial pitch with a similar pedigree? Jordan Nobbs da, Keith, played for Hartlepool. Nowt more illustrious than that.  Updated at 10.34pm BST  10.32pm BST 31 min England win their first corner of the game, overhit from the right by Williams. But they maintain the pressure, Carney turning, coming in off the left and bounding between two players before being run out of it inside the box. But still, better again.  Updated at 11.01pm BST  10.30pm BST 29 min A little ray of hope for England, Kiby appearing at inside-right and skipping past one challenge and bundling through another that eventually relieves her of possession - but at lastm some enterprise.   10.28pm BST 28 min Wold arcs over a cross into the middle, looking for Hegerberg, and shes up early - but Bronze and Bassett, though not exactly marking, are either side enough to be in the way enough, and the ball skids off her head and wide.   10.26pm BST 27 min The players pause to take on board fluids, also known as having a drink, while Jeremy Dresner notes that Norway are playing a wonderful shade of Egil Olsen stuff.  A little, but the movement of the front players is much better than Englands at the moment - its not just long-ball.  Updated at 10.27pm BST  10.25pm BST 25 min England just cant get going here. Duggan is in unsplendid isolation, and the box in midfield means that the players arent close enough to one another; every pass is a risk.  10.23pm BST 23 min I should probably point out that its very warm out there - not Ottawa, rather Hottawa. Oh yes.   10.22pm BST 21 min Norway are on top here, Laura Bassett doing very well to insert a toe in front of Hegerberg as she chased Gulbrandsens long ball. I doubt itll be long before we see Sampson make an alteration.   10.20pm BST 18 min Bach, in particular, would not benefit from a jungle makeover, reckons Alex Brown. Might be interesting to plant HM and family in a Congolese rainforest though. A kind of sunny, reality version of this classic show.  10.18pm BST 17 min Lovely diagonal ball over the top from Mykjaland, finding Minde at the far post. But it forces her just too wide, and she runs it into the side-netting from a narrow angle; Rafferty is relieved, because it was she who lost her runner.  Updated at 10.24pm BST  10.16pm BST 14 min I dont know if this proves or disproves your theory about everything sounding better given a jungle makeover, emails Kri Tulinius, but heres a jungle remix of God Save the Queen. Mind you, its been long enough since I paid attention to genre differences that this might be something else than jungle. Thought that counts. Tangentially, I once became involved in a prolonged Twitter row about whether or not there was a difference between jungle and drum n bass. The correct answer, of course, is that there is.   10.13pm BST 12 min Mistake by Carney, left holding her heid as Herlovsen charges through the middle. But Bardsley is out very sharply, narrowing the angle, and Herlovsen, rushed, tries to flick it by her, instead finding her studs. Excellent keeping, but panicked finishing.   10.12pm BST 11 min Duggan seizes on a mistake by Mjelde and sends Kirby into the box, left side. But, unable to decide whether to take on her man or cut back to Duggan, she pauses and is run out of things.   10.10pm BST 9 min Bardsley kicks long, towards Duggan, and she leaps well, but no ones within ten yards of her - England could do with sorting that. Perhaps Carney and Kirby might come in off the flanks, or Chapman be sent forward to help.   10.08pm BST 8 min Bit of composed possession for Norway, Hergerberg coming in off the left, but Houghton marshals her line well, and England get the ball away.  Updated at 11.05pm BST  10.07pm BST 6 min Mykjaland goes in the back of Carney with the ball long gone, and England have a free-kick, 5o yards out, towards the right touchline. Bassett goes long to the far post, looking for Chapman, but overhits the kick and thats that.   10.05pm BST 5 min It really is a bit silly that this competition is taking place on artificial surfaces, and we see why when Carney nashes after a pass that runs away from her.   10.04pm BST 4 min Norway force consecutive corners down the right, and the second is slung in flat - its dangerous - but Bardsley does excellently to punch double-fisted, with Herlovsen waiting behind her.   10.03pm BST 2 min When the ball goes into touch, England look to build from the back, Bardsley tapping out, and they build well, Williams unfurling a scholesian inside-out pass to find Bronze pacing down the right. Her cross is good, too, but Duggan cant get enough on the glance, and the ball slips off her forehead to safety.   10.00pm BST 1 min And off we go, Norway looking to get Minde at Rafferty immediately.  Updated at 10.01pm BST  9.57pm BST Not that its hard, but God Save the Queen would be a lot better given a jungle makeover. But then, what wouldnt.  Updated at 9.57pm BST  9.56pm BST Theres been a lot of talk about how confident Norway are, and they certainly look like they enjoyed the tension of the tunnel more than England, who seem very focused.   9.55pm BST Things you dont expect to hear: Jonathan Pearce referencing Henrik Ibsen. Things you do expect to hear: Jonathan Pearce referencing that Norwegian commentary.  So, I suppose thry cancel out, but feel free to send in your unexpected hearings - and, while were here, sightings. One to get you going: a minor UK comedy actor sneakily smoking an e-cigarette during the sermon in synagogue (contravening the laws of the Sabbath).   9.51pm BST Email, with Cathal Chu: Weve now reached the knock-out stages of the Womens World Cup, but there has been no sign anywhere in Canada of the self-proclaimed godfather of womens football. I wonder why? Think hes at Butlins Minehead.  Updated at 9.52pm BST  9.45pm BST So, Sampson has picked a team to counter the specific long-ball threat of Norway. Chapman - ready for a big game - will help shield the defence, and the full-backs offer plenty going in both directions, with Bronzes ability to stop the cross considered of particular value.   9.31pm BST Back to the teams, England have made four changes - curiously, three at the back, where Bronze, Bassett and Rafferty come in. In midfield, Katie Chapman, who did not start the competition well, replaces Jordan Nobbs, Mark Sampson doing his best to ensure his team arent outworked or outmuscled.   9.26pm BST The winners of this tie will meet Canada in the next round; theyve just beaten Switzerland 1-0, and their manager is flexing his large muscles, already accentuated in tight-sleeved, turned-up shirt.   9.12pm BST Norway: Hjelmseth, Skammelsrud, Tofte Ims, Mjelde, Ronning, Gulbrandsen, Herlovsen,Wold, Mykjaland, Minde, Hegerberg. England: Bardsley; Rafferty, Williams, Houghton, Bassett, Carney, Moore,Bronze, Chapman, Duggan, Kirby. Updated at 9.49pm BST  8.12pm BST Sport, and football in particular, live, thrive and survive on hype and hyperbole. But occasionally, we find ourselves in a situation where none is necessary: we will shortly be entertained by the biggest game in English womens football history.  And they really might win it. They started the group well enough and gradually improved, growing in confidence and conviction, and will consider Norway a difficult but surmountable obstacle; organised and physical, but without Englands flexibility and creativity.  Quite how England will line up is impossible to predict. Manager Mark Sampson has used all 20 outfield players, in a variety of formations and styles, and now, with Jodie Taylor available, can tweak even further. If she is as sharp as she says, and if Karen Carney can find her best form, his will be a difficult team to beat. Kick-off: 10pm"

It is the largest fossil fuel divestment yet, affecting 122 companies across the world, and marking a new success for the fast-growing and UN-backed climate change campaign. A new analysis said the fund would sell off over $8bn (5bn) of coal-related investments as a result. The biggest single sell-off from Norways fund will be the UK utility SSE, in which the fund holds $956m of shares. The fund is also set to sell its $49m stake in Drax, which runs the UKs biggest coal-fired power station. Other major energy companies identified in the analysis by German and Norwegian NGOs are Germanys E.ON ($685m) and RWE ($320m) and the Danish company Dong ($30m), which is often associated with wind energy but has a significant coal business.  Swedens Vattenfall and Italys Enel are also set to be affected by the coal ban as are 35 groups in the US, including Duke Energy ($434m). A dozen coal-related companies on China are set to lose their Norwegian investment, as are eight in Japan and five in Australia. The decision to divest Norways $945m fund from coal assets was made on 27 May, when an agreement between political parties was reached. It was formally passed by a parliamentary vote on Friday. Svein Flaatten, of the governing Conservative party, said coal investments were both a global warming risk and financial risk. A global deal to cut carbon emissions at a crunch UN summit in December could leave some fossil fuel reserves unburnable and worthless. The fossil fuel divestment campaign seeks to persuade investors to dump stocks on the basis that current reserves of coal, oil and gas are already several times greater than could be safely burned. It has seen a string of successes, including last Fridays commitment from French financial services giant Axa sell to $560m of coal-related investments.  The Guardians Keep it in the Ground campaign is calling on the worlds two largest medical charities  the Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust  to divest their endowments from fossil fuels. The Guardian Media Group pledged to divest its own $1bn fund from all fossil fuels in April. Norways finance committee decided the nations fund, known as the Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG), should sell stakes in companies for which mining or burning coal makes up more than 30% of their business, or have projects in development that would tip them over the 30% threshold. The measures are to be implemented on 1 January 2016. The NGOs Urgewald, Greenpeace and Framtiden applied these criteria to the more than 9,000 companies owned by the GPFG to create their list of 122 companies. It calculates the combined value of the holdings to be sold at $8.7bn. The GPFG is funded by revenues from Norways large oil and gas production.  This is the biggest divestment from coal in history and it should pave the way for other investors and countries to follow suit, says Truls Gulowsen, head of Greenpeace in Norway. The significance of the Norway decision is that, because of their size and reach, this will act as a major signal for other investors to follow. This will certainly create a wave, said Mark Campanale, founder of the Carbon Tracker Initiative, which has pioneered analysis of the financial risks of fossil fuels. Norways finance ministry is reported to have calculated that $9bn-$10bn of investments would be affected by the divestment, suggesting that the NGO analysis may be an underestimate. Some major mining companies, such as Anglo American and BHP Billiton, have very large coal reserves and production but are not affected by the new GPFG rules. This is because coal makes up less than 30% of their total mining operations across the world."

This is a fjord full of life  to smother it with toxins is insane, said Arnstein Vestre, president of Young Friends of the Earth Norway, which has been part of protests against the plan. We have 600 people ready to do civil disobedience actions, and we will not stop until the fjord is safe, he said.  Announcing its approval of the project on Friday, industry minister Monica Mland said there would be strict environmental controls and monitoring of waste matter. If Norway wants future workplaces and welfare, we must be competitive, she said. The minerals industry can be a motor for business and jobs in rural areas. The mine could generate up to 500 jobs, she said.  Nordic Mining, a Norwegian company, plans to mine Engeb mountain in south-west Norway for rutile, a titanium mineral used for pigments in paint, plastics and paper. It acquired the rights to the Engeb deposit in 2006, and the price of rutile has subsequently risen fourfold. The deposit at Engeb is one of the richest in the world.  Controversially, over the anticipated 50-year life of the mine, the company plans to dump millions of tonnes of waste from its operations into the adjacent Frde Fjord, one of the countrys most important spawning grounds for cod and salmon and a site where whales and porpoises congregate.  The Norwegian Fishermens Association criticised what it called a political decision to approve the mine, citing fears that heavy metals such as cadmium could be released into the fjord and damage fish stocks.  Marine biologists have warned that very fine waste particles could spread far from the fjord, polluting the food chain and harming its ecosystem. Norways prime minister Erna Solberg recently compared the countrys salmon industry to Swedens furniture giant Ikea in terms of its importance in reducing Norways reliance on oil. Nordic Mining boss Ivar Fossum said in a statement: The Engeb rutile project will strengthen Norways position in the titanium feedstock industry and support regional development and long term growth. Our goal is to establish a profitable mining company in Naustdal based on good environmental solutions and social responsibility. An objection to the plan from the western regions Directorate of Fisheries had been overruled, the company said.  It calculates that after 50 years of operation, tailings from the mine  the materials left over after extracting the valuable minerals from the rock  will cover no more than 13% of the bottom of the fjord, which is more than 200 meters deep. The waste would be safely deposited in the best environmental way and will be free of harmful chemicals, heavy metals and radioactive elements, it said.  The government is taking a huge risk with nature, said Rigmor Andersen Eide, environmental spokeswoman for the opposition Christian Democratic Party. But the mayor of the nearby municipality of Askvoll said she welcomed the decision with relief and joy, while the mayor of neighbouring Naustdal said the campaign of opposition to the mine had helped to make the project a better one.

But the players know, all the same, that the man who will try to lead them to promotion to the Championship this season is a 41-year-old former Royal Marines commando who has seen and done things that make whingeing about pre-season training unthinkable. Of all the theatres of war that I worked in, I didnt like the desert because there was no cover, there was sand everywhere and I thought it was quite a tough environment to work in, says Robertson when asked to single out his most gruelling experience in a green beret. That was in Kuwait, where we did a lot of training with Kuwaiti commandos near the airport just after it had been bombed. But I really thrived in Norway when we did our Arctic warfare training, I would say thats the fittest, strongest and the best condition Ive ever been in. Natural skiing with a 120lb (54kg) pack and four-man tent, Monday to Saturday, week in, week out. Going above the treeline and then coming back down. Unfortunately we lost a few guys on that exercise. Lost? They passed away because of the intensity of the training and the environment. Dagenham-born Robertsons first passion was football  in particular West Ham, for whom as a six-year-old he was a pre-match mascot  but after not being offered a contract by any club by the age of 16, he shelved his dream of becoming a professional player and enlisted in the marines, like his father and grandfather. He loved the military life, completing his commando test at 17 before embarking on active duty, including two tours of Northern Ireland. He would have happily remained a commando until the mandatory retirement age of 40 if not for a virus contracted during jungle warfare training in Guyana in 1995. He had gone to a doctor after emerging from the jungle expecting to be prescribed antibiotics, but tests showed the problem to be more serious than he suspected. Ill never forget the day, he says. I was just about to go out for a 15-mile yomp with one of my mates and I got a phone call off the medical officer from 4/5 commando. He said: Marine Robertson, whatever you do, dont do any physical exercise. Youre booked in to have a pacemaker fitted at Dundee Royal infirmary. I have no shame whatsoever in admitting that I was knocked for six. I didnt even know what a pacemaker was, all I knew was that I was going to have heart surgery. Robertson returned to service after his operation  and even won an award as the marines footballer of the year in 1996  but the pacemaker led him to leave the forces. It didnt affect me physically but I couldnt go on a warship and with all the electronic countermeasures they have now on every battlefield, my days of active service were unfortunately over. So I went to a medical board and got medically discharged. It was unfortunate but maybe now, from down the line, it was a blessing in disguise. Robertson returned to his first love, completing a coaching course at Portsmouth before working with Crystal Palace and, eventually, Peterborough United, where he took charge of youth teams before graduating to the role of academy manager. In 2013 he became one of 178 coaches in England with the Uefa Pro Licence. When Darren Ferguson was sacked in February this year with Peterborough 16th in League One and sliding towards relegation, Robertson was placed in charge of the first team on a caretaker basis and turned the side around, guiding them to a ninth-place finish. In May he was appointed manager permanently after presenting the chairman, Darragh MacAnthony, with a 35-point plan for uplifting the Posh. Im very in-depth and thorough in what I do, and what I didnt want to do was go into that interview process and leave any stone unturned. I knew the chairman was going to interview other people, some who would have more experience as a manager than me. But the chairman definitely understood my ambitions and what I wanted to achieve. But he also needed to understand the process we were going to use to get there so I went through it from top to bottom, covering every area of the club. He is unashamedly ambitious in what he wants to achieve in his first full season as manager: promotion to the Championship, with panache. A lack of penetration was one of Peterboroughs main problems last term  they scored six fewer goals than relegated Leyton Orient  but Robertson has been working on revamping their approach. We want goals, we want players with footballing bravery, which is terminology I use a lot, we want players who are brave enough to deal with the ball in tight areas and have the physical capacity to run in behind and cause problems for defenders, so I want them to be risk-takers, says Robertson, whose side scored 17 goals in their first five pre-season friendlies. The clubs six summer recruits  all for little or no fee, as usual  are attackers. The former West Ham midfielder Jack Collison has been brought in to revive his career after serious injury and there are high expectations around Joe Gormley, the striker signed from Cliftonville after scoring 41 goals in the Irish League last season. I believe he [Gormley] will score 25-plus goals in League One this season and to get him alongside Conor Washington in a strike partnership was a big aim of mine, says Robertson, who also signed Lee Angol, the top scorer in the Conference South last season with Boreham Wood, and Souleymane Coulibaly, a former Spurs reserve who has scored 14 goals in nine appearances for Ivory Coast under-20s. Robertson has spent the summer honing his team. The players have worked harder physically and mentally than ever before, he says. The mental approach was a big thing that I took from my military background because we never ever went into anything without the mindset of wanting to be the best. Adding that to this group has been really important to me and there has been a big change in that side of things. The physical work  all done with a ball  served similar ends. The physical conditioning of the players has helped us to develop that strength of mind because by pushing them beyond the limits they felt they could go, they got that sense of achievement and euphoria that anyone who has been to the limits of physical exertion will understand you get at the end of it. So Ive really linked both of those things into the training programme in a number of different ways. As a result weve got players who can maintain their emotional control while working at the peak of their physical capacity. If we do that, I firmly believe were going to win more games than we lose because the concentration levels will be better and well be able to sense when the right time is to dominate our opponents and go one step further because theyre not trained to do it and not prepared to do it. Thats whats going to give our team an edge. Ever meticulous, Robertson has broken the season down into cycles and set a points target from each one. Each player has also been given position-specific individual targets, anything from percentage of completed passes to their number of positive intentions. The regime is deliberately demanding but intended to be inspiring rather than intimidating. During a visit to the training ground it is interesting to see the players seem buoyant and address their manager as Robbo rather than Mr Robertson, Gaffer or Sir. And how does Robbo address his chairman? MacAnthony is one of the most outspoken owners in the league, one who has been known to respond to poor results by taking to Twitter to berate his staff. Is Robertson ready to deal with such outbursts? I am prepared for that. I actually enjoy the chairmans passion. I phone him every day after training when hes back in the States or I go straight up and see him after every game when hes here. We have a good relationship. He will tell me bluntly how he feels and I will tell him my thoughts quite bluntly. But the good thing with the chairman is you know where you stand and I wouldnt want it any other way. There are so many owners and boards out there that all have different agendas and Id much rather be in a position where I can pick up the phone and have the conversation with the chairman as opposed to having to lobby seven or eight board members or have the same conversation seven or eight times. For me as a manager to have that relationship with the chairman is brilliant. We do have our rants and ravings with each other but its not personal. And he is a good leader. He is the decision-maker and I think the club is in great hands. Peterborough are rightly among the League One favourites for promotion and they are certainly not going to be boring."

National Grid and Statnett, the Norwegian transmission system operator, are due to sign the ownership agreement for the 450-mile (730km) interconnector at the British embassy in Oslo, on Thursday. The two-way 1,400MW electricity cable will run from Blyth in Northumberland to Kvilldal, in Rogaland, on the Norwegian side. It will cost about 2bn (1.5bn) and completion is planned for 2021. The agreement with Norway will save UK households up to 3.5bn over 25 years by importing cheaper electricity, according to an estimate by Britains energy regulator Ofgem.  Ed Davey, the energy secretary, said the deal would give Britain access to Norwegian green hydropower at the flick of a switch, to replace wind turbines in the UK when the wind was not blowing. Davey said: This is a project I have worked on with Statnett and National Grid for two years and I am delighted theyve now made this massive investment decision. It wont be all one-way traffic. We are in the process of investing heavily in new low-carbon generation. In the future we would expect that there will be times when our generation exceeds our demand and we are able to export clean power to Norway in return. There were fears that bad weather at Oslo international airport would prevent the British delegation from flying to the Norwegian capital for the signing, but the event went ahead. Alan Foster, National Grids director of European business development, who signed the agreement, said: Access to low-carbon energy from Norway hydropower stations will help us meet the challenge of greener, affordable energy. It also adds to the diversity of energy sources for the UK and potentially can reduce peak prices with benefits for consumers and businesses. The interconnector will be the first electricity link between Britain and Norway but the countries already have connections supplying Norwegian gas and oil to the UK. They include the 725-mile Langeled pipeline, which runs from the Nyhamna terminal in Norway, to Easington in Yorkshire. Davey said: Norway is one our most important energy partners and so far, our partnership has revolved mainly around the fossil fuel resources in the North Sea. This project moves us into a new phase in which the sharing of renewable power can also make significant contributions to both countries. A group of energy companies announced plans in 2011 to build an electricity interconnector between Norway and Scotland. The proposed 350-mile cable is supposed to be built by 2020 at a cost of 1.75bn. SSE, the British energy supplier, pulled out of the project in 2013. The UK already has electricity interconnectors with France, Ireland and the Netherlands, and wants to add more to meet expected demand for energy. National Grids reassurance in October that there would be no winter blackouts was borne out but analysts have said the UK is vulnerable to energy shocks unless supplies are increased."

Ine Eriksen Soreide said that Russia had recently re-opened military bases in its far north that had been shut down after the cold war, and that there had also been an increase in flights by Russian warplanes close to Norwegian airspace. We have seen in the first couple of months of this year a certain increase compared to the same period last year and ... an increased complexity. We see they fly longer, they fly with more different kinds of airplanes and their patterns are different than they used to be, Soreide told the Guardian during a visit to London.  They have not breached our territory and that is different from what is happening in the Baltic Sea area. They are breaching territory there all the time and in the Baltic area they have also seen three times as many flights as normal or usual, she added. Soreide said Norway was stepping up military cooperation with the Baltic states  Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania  as a means of reassuring them that they were fully covered by Natos collective security umbrella. Furthermore, Norway was absolutely ready to expand training of Ukrainian soldiers, she said, predicting that more Nato states would follow the British example of dispatching trainers and non-lethal equipment to support Ukraine. On the political level I think it is important to define what we are seeing, that this is aggression  whether you see it as cyber threats or information campaign and conventional warfare, it is aggression what they are doing in Ukraine. And I think its important to say this, and that we do not accept this towards Nato countries, the defence minister said.  It is difficult to say what we can expect for the next months but ... because of the new strategic situation and the new security policy situation, we need to be prepared to have not long warning times if something were to happen. So we will need to twist and turn our armed forces a bit compared to how they have been in recent years.  According to the Norwegian defence ministry, the countrys F16 fighter planes at Bodo airforce base on the north-western coast scrambled 49 times in 2014 in response to Russian warplanes flying close to Norwegian airspace, and identified 74 different military aircraft, a 27% increase from 2013. So far this year, there have been four scrambles and 11 Russian aircraft have been identified. The Norwegians have also observed that there have been bigger and more diverse groups of Russian planes flying by, including more heavy bombers, like the Tu-95 Bear, the Tu-160 Blackjack, and the Tu-22 Backfire. On occasion those bombers have extended their training runs along the western coast of Norway and over then either the Atlantic or the North Sea. On 28 January, two Tu-95 Bears which had flown down the Norwegian coast made an unusual turn up the English Channel with their identifying radio transponders turned off, disrupting civilian air traffic.  Soreide said her ministry had no confirmation of reports in the UK and Norwegian media that those bombers were carrying nuclear weapons.  According to Nato figures, alliance aircraft stationed in the Baltic states intercepted Russian military planes 150 times in 2014, a fourfold increase from 2013.  [The Russians] are probably sending messages to the Baltic countries, even though they are Nato members, that this is our [Russian] sphere of influence, Soreide said. At the same time, she added: They are reopening bases in the high north, they are establishing Arctic brigades and command structures. In response, the defence minister said: Right now and today, we have to make sure we can keep our situational awareness, and ... to keep up our presence in the high north, both with frigates and planes. Because one of the most important things we can do right now is to make sure we have eyes on what is happening."

For me the sound of Bergen is rain and footsteps on cobblestones. This is a recording of little Sonja, whos one and a half years old, running through the drizzling rain across the cobblestone on the way to her friends birthday party. Bergens own comic and musical megastars Ylvis are still hugely popular in their hometown. Check out their Youtube-channel for a glance into Bergens somewhat surreal sense of humour. My favorite venue is Bergen Kjtt, located just a stones throw from the famous Bergen Wharf. It used to be a meat factory, but now hosts nearly 300 local artists within various art forms hosting public exhibitions, concerts and performances. It also houses several of Norways leading recording studios. The place has been in the media a lot over the last two years  as the new building owners wants art out and profit in; while the artists have dug their heels in and are refusing to leave.  One of Bergens hardest working up-and-coming acts is the JazzRock-cum-ProgRock outfit Seven Impale; an outstanding gathering of musical talent with references to everything from the groovy 70s to contemporary soundscapes and jazzy experimentation. They perfectly capture the independence as well as originality that defines the true sound of young Bergen. Ive never experienced poetry as vibrant and cool as when performed by Bergen youngster Erlend Ndtvedt. He combines the new and old in both content and language and draws from Northern Mythology and class division in Bergen at the same time. It is all in the broadest Bergen dialect, but check out the poetry short flick Norangsdalen; and you will feel his groove nonetheless.   Bergen is full of indie, metal and electronica people; we all try to give the impression were not following trends  which is a look on its own, I guess. The Bergenser probably most known for creating the look that is in now would be T. Michaels. Hes the go-to guy when the independents want to look sharp. Dolk from Bergen has managed to hide his identity to this day, and has made some of the most iconic street art in and outside the city. Wheelchairs is located near a parking house in Bergen downtown. As with his other works, it highlights human interaction and emotions through quiet, understated stencils. Landmark / Bergen Art Hall is the place for contemporary art; exhibitions, installations and performances. They also happen to host a bunch of great concerts in the not necessarily accessible and commercial , but bursting with artistic integrity end of the scale. A great place for coffee and a bite to eat too. The local political election is coming up this autumn, and Bergen politics has been particularly chaotic these last years. The mayor was accused of corruption, politicians are resigning left and right over the plans for a city tram through (or not through, that is the question) the historical Wharf area, our much loved culture politician left Bergen for Parliament got busted for drug use  and is now making a comeback in Bergen. And so on. So the talk is basically more of an ongoing attempt at understanding what it is going on.  Bergen does original and resounding music like no one else. Whether it is the strangely comfortable darkness in Ryksopps bangers, churning metal-riffs from Enslaved, the jazz-thrills from Kjetil Mlster or introvert pop from Erlend ye (aka The Whitest Boy Alive)  it is all made in Bergen.  The locals put pride in being funny  all the time. It does not always translate, but outsiders appreciate the effort  and the unflinching belief in our own comedy skills. Bergens funniest and possibly most successful comedian is named Dagfinn Lyngb who mixes Bergen naivet, sharp observation and a love for music and sound. When Rolling Stones played Bergen in 2006, it was the beginning of Bergen as a major concert city. No longer did we have to travel over the mountains to Oslo to see our favourites; Iron Maiden, Bruce Springsteen, Neil Young, Foo Fighters and the greats keep coming.

The normally prolific Chelsea striker  and possessor of a first-class honours degree in law  aims to score her first goal of Canada 2015 while helping England win their first knockout game in a World Cup finals.  Related: England can win Womens World Cup  100%, says fit-again Jodie Taylor  So far this month Aluko has largely been required to sacrifice herself for the team, playing the lone-striker role in a 1-0 group stage defeat against France, being part of a front three in a win against Mexico and sitting on the bench during the victory over Colombia. Now Mark Sampsons constantly rotating side have reached the round of 16 she hopes her personal fortunes will change. Its frustrating not to have scored but you have to have the opportunities, says Aluko. In the France game I was asked to play a different role. I dont think many forwards would have had many opportunities in that role. Id love to score in every game but youve got to look at things tactically. Sometimes youve got to do things for the team. All I can do is try my best when Im on the pitch and get in the right positions. At least she has already scored against Norway, albeit 18 months ago in Sampsons first game in charge of England after succeeding Hope Powell. Much has altered for both sides since that 1-1 draw at La Manga in southern Spain but the memory still encourages Aluko as she targets securing a central starting place in the face of intense competition from, among others, the newly fit Portland Thorns striker Jodie Taylor. Its nice to know Ive got a goal against Norway, she says. But it does feel a long time ago. A lots happened since then. Theres been a lot of changes tactically and a lot of changes emotionally for us. But, as a forward, it always helps psychologically if youve scored against a team before. It would be brilliant to do it again. But we need to win this time. We have similar strengths to Norway. Theyre strong, physical, hard to break down but well look to play in a way where we can get our best attacking players on the ball as quickly as possible. The nature of the game will be different. Its a knock-out match and set plays are going to be important. It will be 10pm in the UK (5pm in Ottawa) when the game kicks off but Sone Aluko will not contemplate turning in for the night until well after the final whistle. At 26 the Hull City striker is two years younger than his sister and the pair are extremely close. I talk to my brother all the time, says Eniola. I talk to him a lot before games and he gives me loads of advice. Hes very proud of how I played against France. Hes hoping to come out to Canada and watch me if we go a bit further in the tournament. Sampson remains adamant England can win this World Cup but, while Aluko does not disagree, she emphasises it will not be easy. I hope we can get through the round of 16, she says. We have to believe we can. Norways strong. They got a great result with Germany, they drew against the tournament favourites and were unlucky not to top their group. It is far from inconceivable that the game could go to extra time and possibly penalties. Aluko was expecting to be summoned for penalty practice immediately after chatting to the Guardian in a cafe just down the hill from the Fairmont, Englands somewhat stately five-star Ottawa home. The hotel, a heavily turreted limestone edifice reminiscent of a French chateau, stands next to the parliament building where preparations for Canada Day on 1 July are in full swing. Temporarily oblivious to her eye-catching surroundings Alukos mind is elsewhere, fixed firmly on those 12-yard kicks. Im sure well start doing penalties today, says the Lagos-born striker. But theres different philosophies regarding penalties. Some people say youve got to practise, practise, practise but others think it doesnt matter so much because nothing can ever recreate taking them in a match situation. There arent actually that many penalties awarded in womens football but I think Im quite good at them. I think the most important thing is knowing what youre actually going to do  and not changing your mind at the last minute. Youve got to decide what youre going to do and stick with it. The problem for Even Pellerud, Norways coach, is the uncertainty surrounding Sampsons game plan and personnel selection. After using every one of his 20 outfield players in three games featuring contrasting starting formations, Englands coach is extremely difficult to second-guess. Pellerud, however, has experience on his side. At almost 62 he is 30 years the England coachs senior and won the World Cup with Norway in 1995. Following stints managing Lillestrom while working in the mens game and then coaching Canadas female side, Pellerud is back with his national team and promises to be a daunting opponent. We know its going to be our toughest game yet, says Aluko. We have to perform."

Norways coach  who led his country to World Cup glory in 1995  will celebrate his 62nd birthday next month, making him virtually 30 years Sampsons senior. Yet while it seemed a case of the master putting the apprentice in his place Laura Bassett and Steph Houghton, Englands central defenders, were largely preventing Pelleruds front three from wreaking too much havoc. Or rather they were until Bardsley did well to turn Gulbrandsens shot round a post. When the corner was whipped in to the near post by Mykjaland, Gulbrandsen dodged Rafferty before heading Norway into a far from underserved lead. As the corner was taken Scott finally came on to replace Kirby, who had been struggling badly throughout. Norways goalkeeper had not had a shot to save but, against all odds, she was soon beaten. The equaliser followed another corner, won this time by Scott. Houghton timed her run to meet Williamss delivery to perfection and her ensuing header restored parity. The moment had arrived for Sampson to liberate Jodie Taylor from the bench. The Portland Thorns striker is his most incisive forward but she underwent knee surgery only eight weeks ago and the coach could not risk sending her on in Duggans stead any earlier. Elise Thorsnes very nearly put Norway back into the lead only seconds after stepping off the bench but her angled shot swerved fractionally over the bar. When Bardsley was forced to save from Hegerberg England appeared up against it again but Taylors pace and Scotts passing had offered them a certain momentum that was amplified as Bronze hit that eye-catching winner. Appropriately the two substitutes created the goal, Scott and Taylor combining to cue up Bronze, advanced from right-back, for a fabulous drive from the edge of the area which Hjelmseth touched but could not hold. By now Norways proud boast of superior fitness rang hollow. Instead Pelleruds players looked to be running on empty and were relieved to see their keeper save well to deny Chapman. Once again Sampson, supported by Bardsleys heroics, had confounded the doubters."

Students at Seljord Folkehgskule, a college 90 miles west of Oslo, are embarking on a new programme to learn traditional Viking skills such as sword forging, jewellery making and roof thatching, as well as the essential art of axe-throwing. The year-long Viking course is the first of its kind and came about after the headteacher, Arve Husby, decided to introduce more traditional courses into his curriculum. Our school used to be really well known for handicrafts, but these started to die off, said Husby. So I had a brainstorming session with other teachers and someone suggested Viking skills to get more students working with their hands. Many Scandinavians spend a year at a residential folkehgskule, or folk high school, before university, where the focus isnt academia or exams, but life skills such as independence and teamwork. These schools are private but government-subsidised, so parents only pay for room, board, trips and teaching materials. Seljord Folkehgskule will set parents back 100,000 Norwegian Krone, around 7,800, a year. Weve been overwhelmed by the response to our Viking course, said Husby. I think it appealed because theres a real interest from TV shows like Game of Thrones and Vikings. Plus were in a proper Viking location, surrounded by what many people call Norways most beautiful mountains we call them hills and overlooking Lake Seljord, where the Seljord monster is supposed to reside, like Norways Loch Ness. So Seljord is just as it would have looked in Viking times.  Five female and nine male students started class in Seljord last week.  They are being instructed in all things Viking by new teacher Jeppe Nordmann Garlya  a lifelong Viking enthusiast and expert blacksmith who got the job after seeing an advert posted on Facebook that had been shared 26,000 times. Its not every day you see an advert for a Viking teacher, so as you can imagine, we had a lot of applications, said Husby, but Jeppe was the best and students love his lessons so far.  There is considerably more gender equality at the school than among the original Vikings. Both sexes are learning to carve wood, forge metal and bake bread as well as honing their archery, shipbuilding and weaving. Husby admitted he did not know how useful these skills will be in the job market (maybe they can make products to sell in different Viking markets in Norway and Scandinavia? he said), but he insists that the real merit was in the learning, which is worthwhile, no matter what you do with it. For instance right now, theyre learning how to make traditional Viking weapons, which is mind-expanding. Other courses at Seljord Folkehgskule include Everest base camp preparation and paragliding skills. These dangerous activities aside, parents of the Viking skills students can at least be assured that local media reports of animal sacrifice on the syllabus have been wildly exaggerated. That parts not true, I mean, we serve meat in the canteen but thats about it. Theres no sacrificing and even Viking-style hunting is off the cards, said Husby. Unless someone spots the Seljord monster of course, then, all bets are off."

Instead of reducing its overall exposure to businesses based on coal, the Norwegian Government Pension Fund (GPF) increased its holdings by 3bn Norwegian kroner to NOK 85.8bn ($11bn/7.3bn) by the end of last year, the report Still Dirty, Still Dangerous said. The finding underlines the difficulties of making sure investors deliver on pledges to get out of coal, oil and gas in response to an anti-apartheid style global divestment campaign. Others, including a key parliamentary committee on Wednesday, have called on the Norwegian pension fund, worth an estimated $850bn and based on the countrys oil and gas wealth, to quit coal for financial reasons. Global coal stocks have plunged more than 70% in value over the past five years, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). However, the Norwegian government pension fund remains one of the biggest single investors in coal mining companies and coal-based utilities, according to the report. While the fund did withdraw from 32 companies last year for environment and climate reasons, it did not reduce its overall holdings in the industry.  Related: World's biggest sovereign wealth fund dumps dozens of coal companies  By the reports calculations, the Norwegian fund had investments in companies responsible for 23% of global coal production. The GPF had merely reshuffled its investments between coal mining companies and electricity producers that rely heavily on coal, the report published by Future in Our Hands, Greenpeace Norway and the German NGO, Urgewald, said. There is meaningful divestment and there is pretend divestment, Heffa Schucking, the author of the report said.  With the Norwegian government pension fund, they simply moved all the money from coal mining companies to coal burning companies so you dont know if there is actual divestment at the end of the day. The IEEFA, a US-based think tank, in a report of its own on the Norwegian government pension fund, said managers should withdraw from all mining companies with more than 20% of their output in coal, and power companies that source more than 20% of their fuel from coal-fired power plants.  Marthe Skaar, a spokeswoman for the fund, disputed Schukings figures. It is wrong to say that the money we got from the sale of coal assets has been used to invest in companies that burn coal, she said in an email. Skaar said fund managers were working with companies to improve their environmental records, and this year wrote letters to the boards of large mining operations asking for their plans for a transition towards a lower-carbon economy. We have specifically asked for their strategy related to a future with less coal demand, estimated cost of separating the mining of coal from the companys mining operations, and to disclose the potential timeline related to this, she said. She also said a number of the coal mining companies produced coal used for steel mills  and not burned for electricity. But the finding spoke to rising concerns of campaigners such as 350.org, which has championed divestment as a way to transition out of a fossil fuel economy.  The Guardian and 350.org are partners in the Keep it in the Ground campaign calling on the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust, the worlds two biggest health charities, to withdraw from the 200 biggest publicly traded coal, oil and gas companies.  Its like committing to fight lung cancer and then doubling your shares in Philip Morris, said Jamie Henn, a spokesman for 350. Its important that institutions commit not only to divestment, but to transparency and sustainable reinvestment.   Ellen Dorsey, the executive director of the Wallace Global Fund who has worked with big investors such as the Rockefeller Brothers Fund on the issue, said the report exposed a critical gap between perceptions and reality. While it is positive that the GPF has taken a strong stand against coal investments and reduced their overall investments in coal production, their leadership on this issue is being squandered when it is revealed that they have purchased new coal securities, she said in an email. It is so crucial that institutional investors are transparent about their investment strategies and holdings, across the board. The report described a scenario in which the GPFremained heavily invested in coal around the world.  In the US, the fund invested more heavily in eight of the 10 biggest coal-burning utilities, the report said. The power companies together burn 335m tons of coal a year, producing 15 times Norways annual greenhouse gas emissions. In China, the fund increased its holdings in Chinese coal companies by 32% compared to 2013, the report found. In Japan, its holdings in coal grew by 21%.  And, while the fund did indeed divest from more than a dozen Indian coal companies, it re-invested 44% of the proceeds in the Reliance Group, which is one of the biggest developers of coal-fired power plants across Asia, the report found.    The Norwegian parliament has scheduled a vote on 5 June on divestment of the sovereign wealth fund.  "

In a further crossover with the mens game, Celia Sasic takes her surname from husband Marko Sasic, a Croat who has had a modest career in Germanys lower leagues and is a son of the former Kaiserslautern, Duisburg and Saarbrucken manager Milan Sasic. If Germany become surprise strugglers, then it might be worth considering that Fatmire Alushi, their gifted PSG midfielder, will miss the tournament due to pregnancy and the Ballon dOr winner, Nadine Kessler, will play no part through injury."

Producers at NRK are searching for a family from Norways indigenous Sami people willing to be filmed on their annual task of herding thousands of reindeer 350 miles from the Finnmark tundra, in the far north-east of the country, to their summer pastures near Hammerfest, with footage broadcast in real time.  It might be boring at times, but live reindeer migration is hardcore slow TV, said Thomas Hellum, an NRK producer. The project is a collaboration between NRKs slow TV department and the Sami programming division. Its an opportunity to give the rest of the country a greater understanding of our culture, said Ole Rune Hatta, of NRK Sami. There has traditionally been conflict between Norwegians and Sami people over land, so this is a way to build bridges. Our way of life is pretty alien to most Norwegians  Oslo is closer to London than it is to the Sami capital, Karasjok  so we want to bring our culture to a wider audience.  Producers are in talks with Sami families willing to share their experiences, but the plan is not without challenges. Filming so far north is a problem because we wont have great satellite connections and keeping a camera stable while its being dragged by sleigh is difficult  one bump and were done for, said Hellum. Because the crew will be moving constantly, everything must be wireless. Oh, and we also dont know when the migration will happen  its usually late April or early May, but dates vary depending on the weather and the reindeers mood. Apparently the animals know when its time to move so the herders work with them. Its basically a TV commissioners nightmare, he said.  Fortunately, NRK is flexible and prepared to clear the schedules with a weeks notice. Hellum is planning a trial run next spring with a view to broadcasting the migration live in 2017. Slow TV has been a big hit in Norway since 2009, when NRK aired the view from a seven-hour train journey to an audience of millions. Since then, it has filmed the horizon from a cruise ship (earning a 34% audience share), screened the 12-hour show about fire, and 24 hours of salmon fishing. People want to get back to nature and theyre searching for a slower pace of life, said Hellum of the surprising success of the genre. Theres something special about live, slow TV. Its like: I wonder whats going to happen next? The answer is: Probably nothing. But you never know!"

The fund, the largest in the world, is one of the top 10 investors in the global coal industry. The move, agreed late on Wednesday, is one of the most significant victories to date for a fast-growing and UN-backed fossil-fuel divestment campaign. It will affect $9bn-$10bn (5.8-6.5bn) of coal-related investments, according to the Norwegian government. Investments in coal companies can have both a climate risk and a future financial risk, said Svein Flaatten of the governing Conservative party, which made a cross-party agreement to implement the selling of coal investments. A series of analyses have shown that the worlds existing reserves of fossil fuels are several times greater than can be burned while keeping the temperature below the 2C safety limit agreed by the worlds governments. Furthermore, authorities such as the World Bank and Bank of England have warned that fossil fuel reserves will be left worthless if the action needed to cut carbon emissions kicks in.  Related: How to divest your personal finance  your questions answered  The significance of the Norway decision is that, because of their size and reach, this will act as a major signal for other investors to follow. This will certainly create a wave, said Mark Campanale, founder of the Carbon Tracker Initiative, which has pioneered analysis of the financial risks of fossil fuels. Coupled with the news from AXA that it was exiting 500m (355m) of coal and investing 3bn in renewables, this is a grim week for the listed coal majors, Campanale said. Tom Sanzillo, a former comptroller of New York State who oversaw a $156bn pension fund, also said Norways move was likely to spark others to do the same: Coal stocks are losing money every day. No investment policy that I am familiar with can keep holding stocks in an industry with catastrophic losses and with no realistic case for an upside. Norway has led, and I suspect they will not be alone for long. Sanzillo, now director of finance at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, said: Coal markets globally are in the midst of a wrenching structural decline. The coal industry has failed to compete with other energy resources, particularly wind, solar and energy efficiency. Heffa Schcking, at German NGO Urgewald and who has written several financial reports on Norways wealth fund, said: This will send a strong signal to investors all over the world. Coal is yesterdays fuel. The new investment policy was approved unanimously by Norways finance committee and will be formally adopted by parliament on 5 June.  It requires the fund, founded on Norways vast oil wealth, to exclude companies earning more than 30% of their revenues from coal or producing more than 30% of their electricity from coal. The fund withdrew from 32 coal companies in 2014 for environmental reasons, but recently faced criticism that its overall holdings in the industry had actually risen. Norways wealth fund owns 1.3% of the entire worlds traded stocks and the new policy is likely to see it shed investments in companies all over the world, including Germanys RWE, Chinas Shenhua, Duke Energy in the US, AGL Energy in Australia, Reliance Power in India and Japans Electric Power Development Corporation. We expect that billions of euros will be withdrawn from the coal industry, says Truls Gulowsen from Greenpeace. This is a huge win for the divestment movement and a real sign of hope that investment patterns can be changed. Bill McKibben, co-founder of 350.org, the organisation leading the global fossil fuel divestment campaign, said: If youd told any of us, three years ago, that the planets largest sovereign wealth fund would begin divesting, we would have laughed. Theres much work to be done taking on coal, oil, and gas but the momentum is definitely on our side. Organisations that have cut or curbed coal investments recently include insurance giant Axa, the Church of England and Oxford University. The Guardian, which is running a campaign asking the worlds biggest health charities to divest, is owned by the Guardian Media Group, which announced it would divest its 800m fund from all fossil fuels in April."

Disagreements broke out about whether or not to exhibit artefacts of the attacks in the very office block that Breivik bombed. There were rumours that the museum planned to exhibit the gun he used, and that it could become a traumatic, daily reminder to civil servants.

The blown-out windows of the office buildings awaiting demolition at the Oslo bomb site are a far more visible reminder to workers than the museum, tucked away in the wrecked basement of the central block.

They are returning to Utya to re-establish the Labour party youth wings annual summer camp on the island. Their return is a show of defiance to Anders Behring Breivik and a tribute to the 69 people he killed  most of them teenagers, the youngest just 14. The organisers of this years event include survivors of that day, but the camp has attracted many new faces. We are sending a message that we are taking the island back, theres a good energy, says Victoria verland, 17, here for her first camp. There were anxious moments when she and her friends boarded the ferry to the island, but the camp spirit quickly took over.  Related: Utya four years on: what's the mood in Norway?  It is a part of the grieving process to take back the place where terrible things happened, verland says. Everyone here is aware of what took place and they have been through a process in their head, though for some people it is really hard. The camps return marks a turning point in a national tragedy that is still unfolding. It is the culmination of a long and painful attempt to find a balance between politics and grief, courage and remembrance, youth and parenthood, moving on and looking back. Utya has posed the question of how, when the fabric of society has been torn, the threads can be woven back together. It has forced Norwegians to weigh the concerns of those directly affected against the wider needs of a nation living with the knowledge that Breivik came from within, and that the virus that spawned him has not gone away. For some, a refusal to reclaim the island would be a victory for terrorism and an affront to the dead. Others want Utya left as a memorial, unable to countenance laughter, music and selfies on the site of slaughter. I dont think Utya will ever be that paradise again, says Lisbeth Ryneland, whose daughter Synne lost her life, aged 18. Ryneland is happy the camp is re-opening, and that young people are getting on with their lives. On the other hand, for me it is a time with many feelings, because Synne isnt with them anymore, says Ryneland, who chairs the national support group for survivors and relatives. But because of the memorial, the 69 who were killed that day will never be forgotten. In a quiet clearing on the islands highest point, suspended from three tall pines, is a massive steel ring cut with the names and ages of the dead. In the circle no one is first, and no one last. The soil below has been planted with flowers to attract butterflies. When the thick mist pours into Tyrifjord, it condenses, and the steel weeps. The spot was proposed by Kolbein Fridtun, who lost his 19-year-old daughter, Hanne, on the island; a dozen parents of children who died have worked to clear the site. But space on the ring remains for seven names missing from the memorial  for some it is still too soon, and the emotions too raw, to imagine their childs absence fixed in metal. Each persons despair moves at its own pace. The parents feel their loss in very fibre of their bodies, says sne Seierstad, novelist and author of a bestselling book on the massacre . Maybe there are longer periods now when they dont think about their children  half an hour or perhaps an hour  but it is there every day. And for most of them, Utya is not their main concern, she said. It was never their island  it belonged to the young people who went there every year, the island of AUF, the Labour partys youth organisation, since 1932, and many future Labour leaders cut their political teeth at the annual summer camp. It is not a place you can just visit to remember. These young people were so in love with the island, Seierstad explains. The terrorist killed them because they were there, so strong, so political and independent-minded. They would probably have wanted their names to be on the memorial. The decision to return was taken on the day after the attacks, says Mani Hussaini, leader of the AUF. This will be the biggest summer camp ever, with talks and workshops on internationalism, feminism and anti-racism, preparation for the next elections  and a lot of fun. Our response is more openness and more democracy in our fight for equal rights. Utya is at the heart of Labour youth. But the left have had to temper their passion to reclaim the ground that Breivik took away. On the day after the attacks, the then prime minister, Jens Stoltenberg, said he would camp out on Utya in a years time. There was a rush to commission a memorial and prepare for an uninterrupted return to the island. The following year a firm of architects called Fantastic Norway presented sketches of bright new buildings and smiling young people. Buildings where children died would be torn down. It was too much, too soon. Plans to commemorate the first anniversary on the island excluded the parents of the dead. It seems they did not understand the force of grief, says Seierstad. For traumatised young people, it was all about moving on. That mistake destroyed a lot. Ragnhild Kaski, the AUFs general secretary, who was 21 when she fled from Breivik on the island, admits blunders were made. The project has changed. It needed to change, she explains. The things you think are right at first are not necessarily the right things to do a few years later  It has been a bumpy road for many of us. Our plans have changed and we have changed as well.  Related: Wounded landscape: how Norway is remembering its 2011 Utya massacre  Talking to the parents helped them to find a balance between learning how to shape Utyas future and remembering its past, Kaski says. Tens of millions of krona have been donated by unions, businesses and individuals to build conference and learning centres as a resource for the labour movement. Meanwhile, for the past two years Labour youth have held a summer camp on the mainland. When they came forward in 2012 with the plans for a new Utya, almost all the survivors and relatives of the dead said they needed more time, Ryneland says. We talked to Labour youth and gave them our advice, which they followed  after that we have had very good communication with them. With the re-opening of the camp this weekend, earlier divisions about the reconstruction have been laid to rest. The event has re-awakened public debate, which had died down since Breiviks trial in 2012. In last years extravagant bicentenary celebrations of the Norwegian constitution, the nations unity after the attacks was barely mentioned. But there have been moments that threatened to undermine the consensus in Norway around how to respond to the attacks. On the third anniversary last year, 19 mothers of the islands dead wrote to Conservative prime minister Erna Solberg asking for Utya to stay closed, and to remain as a place of remembrance. Just north of the island, residents are attempting to sue the government to prevent a national memorial on the mainland. Some locals picked up survivors, the dead and dying from the fjord, and feel that a proposal to dissect a peninsular of rock at Srbrten  creating a symbolic wound in the landscape  would aggravate their trauma. At the new July 22 Centre in downtown Oslo, inaugurated last month, there are also seven blank spaces where parents have asked that their children be excluded from photographs of the Utya dead. Disagreements broke out about whether or not to exhibit artefacts of the attacks in the very office block that Breivik bombed. There were rumours that the museum planned to exhibit the gun he used, and that it could become a traumatic, daily reminder to civil servants. The exhibit that visitors now see includes the remains of the car bomb Breivik detonated outside the prime ministers office just hours before the Utoya shootings, killing eight people. John Christian Elden, a lawyer whose firm represented most of the victims at Breiviks trial, branded it the museum of Breivik, and likens displaying his possessions to placing photographs of Hitler at Auschwitz. For others, labelling it the Breivik museum is just as absurd as calling the 9/11 memorial at Ground Zero in New York a museum to Osama Bin Laden. The blown-out windows of the office buildings awaiting demolition at the Oslo bomb site are a far more visible reminder to workers than the museum, tucked away in the wrecked basement of the central block. Since its opening on 22 July, it has received around 1,000 visitors a day, the museum said  big numbers in this country of 5 million people. Rather than a story of division, however, the new museum and the coming together of parents and activists for the camp in July represent a remarkable tale of unity in facing up to the tragedy. The 9/11 memorial took a decade to agree, and lots of conflict, says Seierstad. For us it has been four years. It could have been so much worse. And yet doubts linger that the deep scar on the national consciousness can heal without concerted effort at the top of Norwegian society. The nature and magnitude of the crime mean that the response to the tragedy cannot be decided only by those directly affected, says Arne Johan Vetlesen, professor of philosophy at Oslo University. For survivors and relatives, wounds inflicted by Breivik might not be visible, but they are no less real. They find it hard to hold down jobs or study, and there is lasting depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress. They have had a lot of problems, there is still quite a long way to go before they are back to their normal health status, says professor Grete Dyb of the Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies in Oslo. She has followed survivors and their parents, and advised Labour youth leaders on how to approach the big decisions they have faced. Tears will flow on Utya island this weekend, Dyb says, but she is confident that the organisers have taken every precaution to ensure any outpouring of emotion will be healthy. Elisabeth Haukelands eldest son and daughter both survived the massacre, and they arent going back to Utya. But her youngest daughter is. Just 13 at the time of the attack, she went straight out to join the Labour youth.  Related: Breivik victims' parents too traumatised to work four years on, research shows  I think she is very brave, Haukeland tells me. All the same, she tries not to dwell on the thought of her daughter on the island this weekend, in a place where her other children suffered so much. I am convinced it would be worse if she was afraid and didnt want to get out and do things. The keenness of AUF leaders to get back on to the island makes sense, Haukeland says, because with each passing year the numbers of survivors eligible to attend the camp will fall, and the memory of 2011 needs to be passed on. Without a grasp of Utyas enormous significance to the labour movement, she adds, it could seem provocative to stress the need for continuity. But despite the strong association of Utya with the left, party politics are largely absent from the public debate in Norway about Breivik. Despite the attacks, in 2013 the country elected a rightwing coalition, which, for the first time, included the anti-immigrant Progress party, of which Breivik was a member for nine years until 2005. People did not vote for the right because they were sympathetic to Breivik, Seierstad says. He has never been cited in political debate, even on immigration or jihadism. The Progress party is less extreme today, she explains, and in any case, has never been linked to the attacks. The Progress party has never been made to pay for Breiviks membership  people are too decent in Norway. Even the youth wing, which is to the left of the Labour party on immigration, has moderate views on asylum. We want more liberal asylum policies, but we also have an understanding that too-liberal policies will cause rightwing ideas to grow, if you cant accept 20,000 each year and integrate them, says Hkon Knudsen, 23, a survivor of the attack and a member of the Labour youth leadership. Outside the July 22 museum, people queue up at lunchtime to get in; as they emerge, many are tearful. Its difficult, but to see it makes it more real, says Karolina, 27, who works in an Oslo law firm. It is important to see the car bomb itself and its effects, and the faces of the dead, she says. For me its a way to show respect for the victims and their families, its important for Norway to remember that these things can also happen here. On the island this weekend, the fresh crop of teenage socialists is more interested in the football tournament and making new friends than discussing the unspeakable presence who robbed their movement of its innocence. No one is talking about him, verland says. Its really surreal  I know that it happened but I cant imagine that someone would come here and do that to young people. The tragedy has changed her perspective on politics, she says, especially on the extreme right, which she fears is growing. It made me think, OK, I can make a difference here. I have to join, I have to do something, I have to help. Everyone is trying to grow from this experience."

This is not enough to sustain a healthy population, Wabakken said.</p>",2015,"Wolves have emerged as the most sought-after animal for Norwegian hunters this season, with 11,571 people registering for licences to shoot 16 animals  a ratio of 723 hunters per wolf.  The animals  of which Norway may have as few as 30 living in the wild  top the league in new figures that reveal a trigger-happy community of hunters.  The Norwegian brown bear comes in a close second with 10,930 registered licence holders keen to hunt down 18 individuals, followed by 10,820 licence holders interested in 141 wolverines, according to the countrys register for hunters.  Related: The bloodlust of modern-day hunters is a disaster for the planet | Philip Hoare  The number of those registering to hunt wolves in the 2015-16 season compares with just under 10,000 people registered for the 2013-14 season  the last for which figures are available, according to the Norwegian Association for Fishing and Hunting. In Norway, the wolf-hunting season begins on 1 October and ends on 31 March.  Norway has a strong tradition of hunting and more than 200,000 registered hunters, most of whom have signed up for automatic notification once the licences are issued. It is viewed as a thrill  and definitely a male domain. Only about 500 women have registered for this years hunt, although the proportion of female hunters in Norway is growing steadily. The main pack of wolves is based in the south-eastern part of Norway, where they also have a designated habitat. However, many individuals wander into other areas of the country  risking their lives in doing so.  Wolves that enter Sweden, Finland or Russia might be luckier since those countries are considered more concerned with sustainability of such fragile animal populations. While neither the wolf nor bear populations are yet at the level sought by Norwegian authorities, decisions to hand out hunting licences are made to protect livestock, according to the countrys environment agency. While licensed hunting is part of a policy to keep predator populations under control, it is suspected that such populations  and especially the wolves  are kept down by illegal hunting, said Petter Wabakken, an internationally acclaimed expert on wolves. He thinks this is particularly disturbing given that Norways wolf population is perhaps as small as 30 animals. Government policy at present allows three breeding females within the designated area. This is not enough to sustain a healthy population, Wabakken said."

But its never gone so far as to annex an entire island of 50,000 people and dump it in another country. A couple of weeks ago, the residents of the sleepy island of Gotland in the Baltic sea off Sweden, started to notice that many of their Facebook entries were listing them as living in Norway, not Sweden.

Weve been hi-jacked by Norway. Of course its a problem for small businesses, she added. We live off tourists and we dont want them to go to Norway, we want them to come here! We dont do fjords.  Mandarva Stenborg, whose public relations company represents Facebook in Sweden, said she was still waiting for a reply from the company, four days after first reporting the problem. I reported it internally to Facebook on Thursday and they havent said anything more, she said. I guess that they have escalated it internally, but I dont have any more information on whether it is a mistake or a bug or anything like that. For Bendelin, this isnt good enough. Dont investigate it, change it, she said. Give us back our island!"

Its 2014 catch of 736 minke whales was more than the combined catch of Japan and Iceland  447 and 261 whales respectively. Commercial whaling was banned almost 30 years ago. Norway, however, has consistently flouted bans on commercial whaling and international trade in whale products through reservations to the international agreements under the International Whaling Commission (IWC) and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.   Related: Japan accused of falsifying whaling data  Reasons for the Norwegian governments continued support for whale meat are complex, but include the fact that key stakeholders in the whaling industry have powerful allies in the government. There is also a misguided belief among senior officials and the fishing industry they serve that killing whales will improve commercial fish catches. Today, a coalition of NGOs including the Environmental Investigation Agency, Animal Welfare Institute and CarbonFix Foundation is launching a campaign calling on Spar Norway, one of the countrys leading food retailers, to stop the distribution and sale of whale meat. The ultimate aim of the campaign is to reduce the market for whale meat and thus the incentive for continued whaling. Spar is an international, multibillion euro enterprise with more than 12,000 stores in 40 countries, the majority of which are overwhelmingly against commercial whaling. Opinion polls in the UK and Germany, for example, found more than 80% of people would be unlikely to buy seafood products from companies linked to whaling.  Norways whaling and associated trade may be technically legal but it is clearly in defiance of international treaties. And the misappropriated methodology used by the country to set its high catch limits has been rejected by the IWCs scientific committee as not being in accordance with the agreed scientific basis for ensuring sustainability. Yet the country manages to mostly avoid international condemnation of its hunts, keeping a low profile at the IWC and allowing Japan and, to some extent, Iceland to take the flak.  Related: Iceland whaling season under way despite protest  Norway has been quietly but steadily increasing its catch in recent years and has its sights set on Japans whale meat market. Japans catches have been drastically reduced after the International Court of Justice ruled that Japans scientific whaling was not for the purposes of science, effectively outlawing its Antarctic whale hunt. A small stumbling block to Norways plans is that Japan has rejected Norwegian minke whale products due to high levels of pesticides, so expanding its limited domestic market is all the more important, although most Norwegians are not that interested in whales as food. The Norwegian government and private entities have created several marketing campaigns in an effort to boost whale meat sales, promoting it to the hotel, restaurant and catering sectors. A marketing association established in 2012 has focused on improving the packaging, advertising and diversity of whale products to tempt consumers.  Yet despite these efforts, and exports of more than 100 tonnes of whale products, Norways whaling industry remains a marginal business. This is why Spar Norway and its parent company, NorgesGruppen ASA, play such an important role. As big name brands with hundreds of stores across the country, they are promoting and facilitating the trade of products that otherwise would not occur. Their involvement doesnt stop there  NorgesGruppen is working with one whaling company to develop a marketing strategy for whale meat, presumably in the hope of significant future profits in the event that the export market opens up.  Whale species are increasingly recognised as essential components of healthy, productive marine ecosystems that contribute to increasing fish stocks and play an important role in our climate. Given that, plus the threat of consumer boycotts, the Norwegian fishing industry and government would do well to take a closer look at why the country continues whaling. Despite its poor reputation, globalisation can be a force for good when major brands spanning multiple countries take a firm stand in favour of conservation and environmental protection. Walmart, Amazon, Rakuten and Tesco have ended their association with the sale of whale products in Japan when prompted by our organisations  we trust that Spar will do the same. "

Conservation groups have revealed that Norwegian exports of minke whale to Japan contained damaging levels of toxic pesticides, making that meat unfit for human consumption. Its a discovery that could cue a swifter decline in the appetite for whale.  The news emerged this month, when the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) and the Animal Welfare Institute (AWI) revealed documents showing that the Japanese government rejected imports of Norwegian whale meat because tests showed samples contained pesticides at twice the limit Japan imposes on its imports. The meat harboured chemicals such as aldrin, dieldrin, and chlordane, thought to play a role in causing birth defects, neurological harm, and some cancers if humans consume them in high quantities.  Norway continues to run a large scale whaling industrythe country took a record catch of 736 minke whales in 2014but surprisingly, it doesnt exist for Norwegians. Fewer than five percent [of Norwegians] eat whale meat regularly, says Kate OConnell, a marine wildlife consultant from the AWI, explaining that they see it as old-fashioned fare.  By comparison, Japan is a much bigger market. Japan has always been the main consumer of whale products, says Clare Perry, the head of the EIAs oceans campaign. But even there, its losing its appeal. Its not fashionable at all. Theres an older generation in Japan that have a nostalgia about eating it, but its not in any way a staple diet, she says. Nevertheless, a chunk of the Norwegian catch is still exported there annually: 137 tonnes of Norwegian minke have entered Japan in the last two years. Proof of pesticide poisoning may somewhat sour that appetite, something that even a global hunting ban hasnt been able to quash. There are three remaining countries that continue to hunt and eat whale commercially  Norway, Japan, and Icelandand each one ignores the worldwide ruling against this activity. In 1982 the International Whaling Commission completely outlawed commercial whale hunting. That applies to all countries that are members of the IWC. Japan, Norway, and Iceland are all members of the IWC, Perry emphasizes. The Convention on Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) also bans the trade in minke meat to protect the species, which isnt endangered but has experienced a dramatic population dive since whaling began. Theres concern over whether the hunt is sustainable, Perry notes. (Norway insists that it is, which explains why it still awards itself an annual catch quota of more than 1000 whales, one the IWC doesnt acknowledge.) When the international moratorium came into force in the 80s, Norway objected to it, which afforded the country a legal loophole that allows it to continue the hunt while maintaining its IWC membership. Norway, Iceland, and Japan also reject the CITES ban, a move that technically permits them to continue with the trade. From our perspective Norway should be abiding by those treaties, Perry says. Until that happens, it seems like pesticide contamination is the whales best defencethough its also bound to harm the whales. The chemicals identified in the minkes meat are agriculture products that would most likely have entered the ocean via agricultural run-off. Some of the pesticides, like dieldrin and chlordane, have been banned in the European Union and the United States because of their toxic effects. Because theyre persistent pollutants, however, theyve lingered in the ocean. By entering the food chain and bioaccumulating within it, the chemicals eventually find their way into the bodies of larger mammals like whales. If we think its potentially dangerous for us to eat, you can imagine its not particularly healthy for a whale, Perry says.  As Norways appetite for the meat dwindles, it continues to pursue markets elsewhere for its whales. But that may grow more challenging, especially since the recent meat scare isnt the first the country has caused. In fact, in the past, shipments of Norwegian whale meat have been found to be infested with bacteria and also to contain potentially dangerous levels of mercury. Within Norway, there are ongoing efforts to try and revive the meats appeal, and there are even generous government subsidies in place to try and support the industry and keep this historical practice alive. It is clear, however, that without an export market, the Norwegian whaling industry will continue to struggle, OConnell says.  In that sense, perhaps for whales the pesticides are a morbid kind of defence against the minority that still has a taste for their meat."

But, behind the ice-cool facade, tensions in recent weeks have been boiling over in an off-stage drama in which the operas staff have been compared to the Hebrew slaves singing for freedom in Verdis Nabucco. Singers and musicians have staged a palace revolt against the director, Per Boye Hansen, who in turn has rallied support from opera stars across Europe and hinted at a Kafka-like vendetta against him. Each side has traded allegations in the media, revealing a violent clash of egos and ambitions in the world of classical opera. The very public washing of dirty linen was triggered by a surprise announcement from the board in May that Hansen, against his wishes, had been told to leave when his contract expires in two years time. The Norway operas internationally renowned boss has faced artistic criticism from a conservative cultural establishment, but also from his staff, who have baulked at his allegedly autocratic leadership style. The criticism has exasperated the cognoscenti, according to whom Hansen is quite simply one of Europes finest cultural leaders. In a letter to Norways government, 16 international opera figures pleaded for the 57-year-old to stay on after 2017, arguing that his devoted efforts in his homeland had made the Norwegian national opera one of the leading ensembles outside Scandinavia. This was effectively a vote of no confidence, they couldnt work with Hansen. It was a palace revolt. Eivind Gullberg Jensen, one of Norways best-known classical conductors, said he was shocked Hansen would have to go so soon. He has barely begun, and he has done a brilliant job so far, he told the Guardian. Pianist Leif Ove Andsnes said Hansens departure was incomprehensible, after he had set the opera house on the map internationally.  However, from inside the opera itself, a different story has emerged. Ellen Horn, the opera boards outgoing chairman, said Hansen had been a brilliant opera director who had lifted it into an international league. But the board had received reports of concern from staff, which it had investigated, she said. Anonymous comments from staff appeared in Norwegian media alleging that Hansen was manipulative, uncompromising and prone to outbursts. For three years, they had endured a moody and self-centred boss, according to an opinion piece in the newspaper Dagbladet by lecturer and musician, ystein Imsen. Hansen responded with a seven-page letter that was leaked to the press, in which he claimed he had not been told of a single verifiable, concrete event or action that supports allegations of misconduct or unacceptable management style from my side. He told the Aftenposten newspaper: Creating art is not an exercise in democracy. The row has focused attention on Hansens artistic achievements. Calling on the director to quit immediately, the tenor ystein Wiik said he could not understand why Hansens production of Offenbachs Tales of Hoffmann had been set in a landfill, with Hoffmann himself staggering around drunk and a bottle of whiskey glued to his hand. Hansen had staged several offbeat productions with provocative, tasteless antics, said Henning Hholt, editor of online reviews magazine Kulturkompasset. He thought Norway was ready for that. But he cant just take his friends from Germany up here and expect we will also say How wonderful!. People dont want to see it. Paul Curran, Hansens predecessor as director of the Norway opera, resigned six months before his contract expired after a disagreement with the chief executive.  There has been an awful lot of criticism at every level, Curran said. Numerous former colleagues at the opera had said they had written a letter to the chief executive, Nils Are Karstad Lys. This was effectively a vote of no confidence, they couldnt work with Hansen. It was a palace revolt.  But Curran also pointed to the very different workplace culture in Norway, in which there is a strong ethos of fairness and Janteloven, or the law of Jante  a Scandinavian phenomenon where no one can be considered to be better than anyone else and everyone, including the cleaners, must have an equal say. It is harder to run an opera house in Norway than in Berlin, Jensen said, because in Germany, a leader is expected to use their power combined with very good artistic leadership. In Norway, if you stick your face too far forward you somehow have to pay for it. Baritone Espen Landvik, representing soloists at the opera, wrote on his blog that since Norway abolished its aristocracy in 1814 its society had had a flat structure, and its not so easy to swallow for many. The opera director is at the top and has ultimate control, but a production should be the result of collaboration with the performing artists based on cooperation and mutual respect, Landvik added. Jan Koop, a German cellist and steward for the MFO musicians union at the opera, said employees in Norway enjoyed stronger workplace rights, so an opera director couldnt just come in and change everything. The board has had to look at what the employees need to deliver high quality, Koop said. Thats probably a bigger issue here than abroad, because employees are better protected and better organised  and we dare to speak up about problems. Hansen, Lys, Horn and Landvik declined to comment."

The justification was the threat that Reliance, as a minority partner in oil exploration in one of the remotest parts of Perus Amazon, was considered to pose to indigenous people who live so remotely they are sometimes described, misleadingly, as uncontacted. The Councils recommendation read: There can be no doubt that the exploration activity undertaken by Repsol [the majority partner] and Reliance Industries contributes to increase the risk that indigenous peoples, who may be living in voluntary isolation within the block, will come into contact with outsiders. The Council notes in particular that the exploration phase seems to be particularly harmful to uncontacted peoples. There can thus be no doubt that there is a connection between the companies operations and the risk of [serious or systematic human rights] violations taking place. The Councils main concern about contact was that it would inevitably lead to the introduction of diseases such as influenza, diarrhea or chickenpox.  There is no scientific disagreement about the fatal consequences that this would have, the Council stated. Past experience from other cases where indigenous people in voluntary isolation have been contacted shows that one third to one half of a tribe will probably perish during the first five years following initial contact. In the worst case, the whole tribe may become extinct. The Council repeated its recommendation in 2012, but it was never acted upon because Repsol - not Reliance, mind - subsequently decided to sell its 55% stake in the operations to UK/French firm Perenco, which the GPFG, the worlds largest sovereign wealth fund, doesnt invest in. That led the Council to do a u-turn in April 2014, stating that Repsol could no longer be considered to contribute to possible violations of human rights. . . insofar as it no longer is a partner in the joint venture and the grounds for recommending Repsols exclusion [from the GPFGs investment universe] are no longer present. And Reliance? Preposterously, the u-turn applied to the Indian company too, despite the fact that it retained its share - 10% - and would carry on as a partner to Perenco. The Council stated: As there is currently no exploratory activity taking place in the block, and since the organisation of the new joint venture is as yet unknown, the grounds for Reliances exclusion has also changed. The Council on Ethics does not currently recommend the exclusion of the company from the fund. The Council will nevertheless reassess the risk of the company contributing to human rights violations when the new joint venture is established and activity in the block starts anew. However, it appears that Perenco is now gearing up to explore. A brief article in Peruvian newspaper Gestion recently reported that the company plans to spend US$10 million on seismic tests across a 108 km squared area. Asked by the Guardian if it could confirm that, Perenco emailed: Block 39 [or Lot 39, as the concession is called] entails an exploration commitment from the operator. At this stage, the possibility of a survey in certain limited areas of the Block remains a matter of discussion between the relevant parties. As such, it is not appropriate to comment further. What is the Council on Ethics going to do about this? Will it, for the third time, recommend that the GPFG divest from Reliance, whose chairman and managing director, Mukesh Ambani, The Economist called Indias most powerful tycoon and Indias richest man? If that was to happen, and if such a recommendation was actually to be heeded , Reliance would become just one of four companies blacklisted by Norway for human rights reasons, along with Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Wal-Mart de Mexico SA de CV and Chinas Zuari Agro Chemicals. A third partner in Lot 39 - a 745,000 hectare area in the very northern Peruvian Amazon near the border with Ecuador - is Vietnams state oil and gas company PetroVietnam, which has a 35% stake. Perenco and PetroVietnam are also joint partners in another concession, Lot 67, which is effectively inside Lot 39 and from which oil has already been produced.  A reserve for indigenous people in isolation (IPI), as Peruvian law calls people living without regular contact, was proposed for this region more than 10 years ago, but has never been established. Progress made by Perus Vice-Ministry for Inter-Culturality towards creating the reserve was set back in 2013 by the then incoming Vice-Minister, Patricia Balbuena Palacios, following an appeal by state oil and gas licensing company Perupetro.  The vast majority of the proposed reserve is overlapped by Lot 39 and Lot 67. Perenco has previously claimed that there is no evidence of IPI in the Lot 67 region, and asked by the Guardian if it argues the same for the surrounding, much larger Lot 39, the company stated, All activities on the Block (including regarding indigenous people) are covered by Perus existing strict regulations. Evidence of IPI in the Lot 39 and Lot 67 region has been collected by indigenous organisations and others for many years.  The Council on Ethics only made public its 2010 and 2012 recommendations regarding Reliance and Repsol in September 2014.

Related: What would a UK outside the EU look like? | Mark Leonard  It also has its roots in the process that began as the cold war was coming to an end in the late 1980s, when the then members of the European Free Trade Area (Efta)  Finland, Sweden, Austria, Switzerland, Iceland and Norway entered into negotiations with what was then the European Community to form the European Economic Area (EEA), extending the single market to Efta. The process succeeded and the EEA was declared in 1992. While still negotiating, however, several Efta states chose to seek full membership of the European Union itself. Austria, Finland and Sweden all joined the EU in 1995, while Norway voted to stay out. Switzerland chose not to join the EEA, whereas Liechtenstein joined a few yearslater. Since then, the EEA has become Norways national compromise on Europe. As an EEA member, we do not participate in decision-making in Brussels, but we loyally abide by Brussels decisions. We have incorporated approximately three-quarters of all EU legislative acts into Norwegian legislation  and counting. We have legally secured access to the single market, and we practise the free movement of people, goods, services and capital. Norway is more closely integrated into many aspects of the EU than even some of the EUs members. Our subscription to freedom of movement and our membership of the Schengen area means that Norwayhas even higher per capita immigration thanBritain. Those campaigning for Britain to leave the EU and chose the Norwegian way can hence correctly claim that a country can retain access to the single market from outside the EU. What is normally not said, however, is that this also means retaining all the EUs product standards, financial regulations, employment regulations, and substantial contributions to the EU budget. A Britain choosing this track would, in other words, keep paying, it would be run by Brussels, and it would remain committed to the four freedoms, including free movement. Without full European Union membership, however, it would have given up on having a say over EU policies: like Norway, it would have no vote and no presence when crucial decisions that affect the daily lives of its citizens are made. British voters might also hear about the virtues of the Swiss model. It so happens that I currently live in Switzerland. My new alpine homeland is in most respects in a similar position to Norway, but instead of the EEA, it has chosen an array of bilateral agreements with the EU on most aspects of integration. Compared to the EEA arrangement it can be seen as an even more cumbersome way of integrating into a EU-led market. Where the EEA is dynamic  which means it trails the developments of EU policy in all relevant areas  the Swiss arrangements are static.

We understand that people may be concerned following todays arrests, however, we would like to reassure communities that todays activity is as a result of an ongoing investigation which is intelligence-led. There is no evidence to suggest that communities are at risk. Elsewhere in Europe, six suspects were detained in Italy and three in Norway. At the centre of the alleged extremist ring targeted is Najmuddin Faraj Ahmad, a radical Iraqi preacher who lives in Norway and is known as Mullah Krekar. Authorities said Ahmad was the driving ideological force behind the organisation, even while serving a separate prison sentence in Norway, where he has lived since 1991.

Before the raid occurred, Ahmad was facing an 18-month prison term for praising the murder of the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists at the start of the year. He will appear in court on Friday alongside the other two people arrested in Norway, and could be deported to Italy. Italian police said the arrests were the result of complex and protracted investigations that began in 2010 following the discovery of a jihadi website ideologically affiliated with al-Qaida. Through the website, the Italian authorities said they could identify so-called navigators who were showing signs of being radicalised. Working with other investigators in Europe, the Italian police said they had documented the existence of an Italian terror cell dedicated to recruiting and radicalising militants online. The Italians also said they had worked closely with US authorities and police but did not specify how the Americans aided in the investigation. The use of the internet allowed the suspects to erase the distance between members, who were residents in several European countries, and enabled them to maintain strong cohesion as a group, reinforced by periodic and frequent online chats, the special operations group (ROS) of the carabinieri said in a statement.  Italian authorities say Rawti Shax is a terror organisation rooted in Europe. They claim it is especially active in Germany, Switzerland, the UK, Finland, Greece, Italy, Norway, Iraq, Iran and Syria.  Eurojust, the EU agency that coordinated the dawn raids, said the alleged terrorist group had become active in providing logistical and financial support to recruiting foreign fighters to be sent to Syria and Iraq with the intent of training them for the future conflict in Kurdistan. Eurojust said other unnamed suspects could not be located and were believed to have travelled to Syria and the Middle East to join extremist groups including Isis and al-Nusra Front. Planning for the operation, led by the carabinieri and directed by public prosecutors in Rome, began in September, it added. The investigations and continuous cooperation have been going on for years in Italy as well as other European countries, particularly Switzerland and Germany, progressively revealing the structure and operations of the terrorist organisation, Eurojust said in a statement. Italys interior minister, Angelino Alfano, said: We are a country exposed to the international risk of terrorism because we are part of that great international coalition that is opposed to the caliphate. Italys preventive measures had worked, he added."

One the one hand the Norwegian city feels like a ode to a nordic Wes Anderson; all cobbled streets, custard-yellow wooden houses and cinnamon buns. More than once I was tempted to make the frankly stupid purchase of a pastel-coloured typewriter from one of the many antique shops  held back only by the impracticalities of carrying it back in my hand luggage. Yet this twee capital of fishing and fjords, which is the biggest in Norway after Oslo, also happens to be at the centre of numerous underground DIY music movements. For a while it was the home of black metal, then gave birth to the Bergen Wave of the 1990s, progressing to a plethora of new rave bands a decade later and now spawning the Scandi pop wave. It hasnt always lasted of course  one half of the Bergen music duo Datarock, who back in the day were part of NMEs eponymous 2009 tour with Klaxons, now runs Bergens best restaurant. Proof that where new rave failed, neu-nordic cuisine can prevail.  It is against this backdrop that Bergens annual music festival, Bergenfest, takes place. Now in its 22nd year, it has expanded from a festival orientated around local talent to one that attracts some of the biggest names on the festival circuit. This year featured Patti Smith, Tori Amos and Bastille alongside Ryksopp and Norways EDM wonderkid Kygo. Its also pretty tiny.

That most modern of anxieties, festival FOMO (fear of missing out) is also helpfully eliminated by the fact barely any of the acts overlap. It is under a bleak and ominously grey sky that St Paul and the Broken Bones take the stage on Friday afternoon, a setting that seems somewhat incongruous with this seven-piece soul band from Birmingham, Alabama. Well hellooo Norway, drawls singer Paul Janeway with all the cadence of a gospel preacher, before launching into an electric rendition of Dixie Rothko, accompanied by all the hip thrusting and ass shaking that makes him one of the most captivating frontmen around. Its no easy feat warming up this shivering Nordic crowd, but as the saxophones kick in for a Sam Cooke cover and Janeway instructs everyone to shake it like a bowl of soup, an energy suddenly grips the audience. Beautiful cagoules are stripped off (this is city who knows how look impeccable in waterproofs) and beer cups thrown to the floor as the awkward foot shuffling gives way to some all-out shimmying.  Bit o'Alabama soul warming up a stony Nordic crowd at Bergenfest @StP_BrokenBones https://t.co/wAANUZou74 Its an energy thats kept up with an infectiously spirited set from Omara Bombino Moctar, the Tuareg singer and guitarist from Niger.

Im so old I forgot my lyrics, Amos tells the crowd, brandishing her notes in the air. Look, it happens  but menopause can be hot too, she says before breaking into 1994s Take to the Sky, thrusting her crotch and ferociously smacking the piano as if to prove her point.  It is on Sunday afternoon that the dark skies of Bergen finally open up in apocalyptic style, just as Death Cab For Cutie take to the stage.

The thinktank says that official impact assessments estimate that the 100 most costly EU regulations, which cost 33.3bn a year, provide benefits of 58.6bn a year. But Open Europe says that 95% of the benefits highlighted in the impact assessments have never materialised. Costly regulations include the working time directive (4.2bn a year) and the UK renewable energy strategy (4.7bn a year).  Related: Gordon Brown: The truly patriotic British view on Europe? We must lead from within  Pawel Swidlicki, research analyst at Open Europe, said: The bad news is that overall, EU regulation costs too much in relation to the benefits it generates. The even worse news is that if the UK left the EU and became like Norway, 94% of the cost associated with the most burdensome EU rules would remain in place but the cost would be even harder to cut, since Norway has no formal voting powers over EU rules. Radical reform from within the EU or a far better trading model outside of it remain the UKs best options for cutting regulatory costs. Pro-Europeans will argue that the report shows that opponents of EU membership have yet to outline a credible alternative. David Cameron said recently that the anti-EU camp has issued contradictory statements about the alternatives to EU membership. Writing in the Guardian earlier this month, Gordon Brown argued that new arrangements outside the EU, along the lines of those negotiated by Norway and Switzerland, would not work. The former prime minister wrote: The Britzerland or Norwegian alternatives (even Norwegians oppose the Norwegian option) leave us subject to EU rules, but denied a vote in shaping them. Opponents of Britains EU membership are likely to read Open Europes report as suggesting that one of the best ways to free Britain from costly EU regulations would be to negotiate a better trading model outside the EU. But in a report in 2012 Open Europe said there were problems with all four models outside the EU. In addition to the Norway option, the other alternatives identified were:  The Swiss option, in which the UK would negotiate a free trade deal with the EU. But this would probably exclude Britains financial services from the EUs single market.  A stripped-back customs union with the EU, known as the Turkish option. Britain would have access to the single market but would face a dependent relationship with the EU because it would be bound by the EUs external trade deals.  A clean break which would see Britain leave the EU and negotiate trade deals through its membership of the World Trade Organisation. Open Europe said of this option: There would be a major price to pay for this. In the absence of preferential trade agreements with either the EU or other countries, exporters in the UK would suddenly be faced with new tariffs."

Before a visit to London, during which he will meet Foreign Office ministers and officials, Vidar Helgesen, Norways minister for the European Economic Area (EEA) and EU affairs, told the Observer that his country often found it difficult to shape economic rules that affected Norway  often cited by Eurosceptics as a shining example of how a nation can thrive outside the EU  while not being a member. He also said that at a time of burning security crisis not seen since the cold war, most key meetings were now being convened at EU level, rather than within Nato, and it was vital that the UK was there to shape decisions. The comments come as an Opinium/Observer poll shows that a majority (51%) would vote today to leave the EU. Helgesen will expand on his view that the UK should not leave in a talk to the pro-EU campaigning group, British Influence, entitled, The European Union: why one who has not joined thinks that WE should not leave. Largely as a result of its oil resources, Norway is one of the wealthiest countries in Europe, with a higher per-capita income than the vast majority of its member states. British Eurosceptics often say the Norwegian experience is evidence of how a country outside the EU, but enjoying the benefits of the single market through membership of the EEA, can prosper without having to commit itself to full membership. Helgesen said, however, that this arrangement often created frustrations and difficulties, which meant Norwegian ministers and officials spent a lot of time  sometimes without success  trying to find out what was going on in EU meetings that would affect their country directly. We [Norway] are fully integrated into the EU single market as members of the EEA, but what we dont have is the right to vote on those regulations that are incorporated into our law when they are made by the council of ministers. On occasion, Brussels has sprung surprises that the Norwegians could not predict. The same kind of frustrations could well face the UK. You would not have all those Brits staffing the commission where the decisions are made, said Helgesen. Britain being on the outside would obviously not have that amount of people on the inside. You would find it more difficult, as a result, to affect the regulations. THe said the current Norwegian government, a coalition between Conservatives and the Progress Partycorrect, which came to office in 2013, had found that the previous administration had not done its homework and paid insufficient attention to regional policy guidelines that were going through Brussels. As a result, it discovered that Norway had to abandon an employment tax-deduction system that had worked well for sparsely populated areas in the north, resulting in negative effects on businesses which suddenly found themselves with much higher costs. It is up to the British to make the decision [as to whether they leave the EU], but I would not think that if the Norwegian model were applied, that this would be ideal, Helgesen said. Norway has held two referendums on whether to join the EU. The first, in 1972, saw the country reject membership by 53.5% to 46.5% of voters. A second ballot, in 1994, also favoured rejection, this time by the narrower margin of 52.2% to 47.8%. If the Tories win the general election on 7 May, David Cameron has promised to hold an in/out referendum by the end of 2017, after trying to renegotiate the terms of British membership. Most Tory ministers and MPs would support leaving the EU if the status quo remains. Helgesen said it would not only be difficult for the UK outside the EU, it would also be bad for Europe, both in terms of economic and security policy for the region. I think there is now a receptiveness in the EU for smarter regulation, less regulation and the EU caring more about the big things and less about the smaller things, he added. I think Britain has very important inputs to make in that process. And I also think that Norway  and Europe  is better served by the UK continuing to be a member. We have a burning security crisis in Europe not seen since the cold war. At that time, Nato was the sole organisation shaping western security. Today, the European responses to Russias actions are predominantly being shaped in the EU. Nato as a military alliance is essential to our common security. But lets be honest, the foreign and defence ministerial meetings in Nato are fewer and less frequent than the foreign affairs council meetings in the EU. As a consequence, the EU provides the main ongoing forum for calibration of policy. I have a hard time seeing that policy shaped without the UK wanting to be at the table. British Influences director, Peter Wilding, said: Eurosceptics who peddle the myth that Norway is the best [model] for a non-EU Britain are deceiving the British public. They say leaving leads to more democracy and security. This is nonsense. We now have the Norwegian Europe minister himself telling us to get a grip, get real and get involved in shaping Europe. Little England cannot be an option, Wilding said."

Karl Ove Knausgaard, whose bestselling memoir has been a global literary sensation, is fronting a campaign to mount a legal challenge against moves by Norway to open up the Arctic to oil companies.  Norway is one of the richest countries in the world  its all about greed, and its a fucking disgrace. Oil and gas extraction in the Arctic has nothing to do with worthwhile goals such as alleviating poverty, Knausgaard said. Norway is one of the richest countries in the world  its all about greed, and its a fucking disgrace. The environment was the single most important issue of our time, he said, and his feeling of helplessness in the face of environmental destruction made him just turn away from it and try to think about something else. But Arctic oil exploration was different, he said.  The Arctic is one of the few places left on the planet that still is unexploited, its a very sensitive area, and I never believed that my government actually would do such a thing. We need to make them stop, and we still can do that.  The shortsightedness and the stupidity of it just makes me want to cry. A petition launched by a senior barrister has gathered the signatures of 200 leading cultural figures and environmental organisations, who see it as a first step towards winning broad public support and raising the money needed for a court case in the autumn. The campaign aims to make use of a recent change to the constitution which obligates the state to take action to ensure natural resources are managed on the basis of comprehensive long-term considerations, including safeguarding the environment for future generations. Persisting with business-as-usual extraction [of oil] on the Norwegian continental shelf contradicts the precautionary principle and climate scientists warnings, the petition states. Opening new areas of the Arctic for oil exploration would make Norway one of the frontrunners in a fossil-fuelled race towards an uninhabitable planet.  The Norwegian government in January announced the first expansion of oil exploration into entirely new areas for 20 years, opening a licensing process in the Norwegian Sea, Barents Sea and waters that stretch some 40 miles further north to the edge of the Arctic sea ice. New and attractive exploration sites are important to long-term value creation and to maintaining the oil industrys contribution to Norways welfare society, the government said when it announced the plan.  Although the price of oil collapsed on world markets last year, forcing oil companies to scale back their drilling plans, there is expected to be considerable interest in licences to exploit Arctic minerals, seen as lucrative assets for the longer term. The Arctic has been heralded as the next big frontier for oil exploration, with the region estimated to hold some 13% of the worlds undiscovered oil and 30% of its undiscovered gas.   Related: The real story behind Shell's climate change rhetoric  Environmentalists received a setback this month when Shell won conditional approval for its Arctic exploration plans from the US regulator. Norways government insists that oil exploration is subject to stringent health, safety and environmental requirements.  Lars Andreas Lunde, environment secretary in Norways right-wing coalition government, said discharge permits for oil activities were granted by the Norwegian Environment Agency, and objections would be heard by the environment ministry. This should ensure that no permits are granted unless the environmental challenges related to a specific activity are sufficiently dealt with and not putting the Arctic environment at risk, he said. Oil continues to make a huge contribution to Norways prosperity  investment income from the countrys $916bn fund set up to manage oil profits is comfortably more than total public spending. But there are fears that reliance on oil is too great, and the government is actively trying to expand other sectors of the economy. It has also pledged to cut greenhouse gases emissions by 40% by 2030, a goal critics say sits uncomfortably besides aggressive exploration for oil and gas. The campaign by Norwegian environmentalists aims to mirror similar legal challenges in the Netherlands and in the US, where lawsuits have attempted to hold governments to account over climate change. In April, the Dutch Urgenda foundation launched the first case in the world to use human rights and tort law to hold a government responsible for failing to reduce carbon emissions fast enough. Where do we draw the line if not in the Arctic?said sne Seierstad, the bestselling Norwegian author and another signatory to the petition. No economic policy is more short-term than relying on profits from the very areas that are worst affected from climate change."

Thomas Nilsen told the Guardian he had no reason to disbelieve the report from the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK), and that it would be awful if it were true that the FSB, Russias security agency, was involved. In what could develop into a scandal in the European Arctic, Nilsen was last week controversially fired as editor of the Barents Observer for having acted disloyally to the newspapers owners.  The title is owned by Norwegian Barents Secretariat (NBS), a local government body that promotes good relations with Russia in a region where the two nations cooperate and compete over fishing, oil and military strategy. Remaining Observer staff, who publish the cross-border news service in English and Russian, initially lamented what appeared to be Norwegian government censorship. But the affair took a fresh twist on Saturday when the NRK quoted an anonymous government official who said the FSB had asked Norways government to silence the Observer. I dont know what is behind this source. But I know the journalist [Tormod Strand] that has written it and he is one of the best journalists in Norway and the Norwegian broadcaster is not making up such stories, no way, Nilsen said. The thought of any involvement by the Russian intelligence service into a Norwegian-based publication is quite awful ... That is, to my mind, a very dramatic situation. The Norwegian Foreign Ministry did not rule out the possibility that the report was true. A spokesman said the government had no information supporting the anonymous allegation. The Russian embassy in Norway told NRK it denied the accusation of meddling. The head of the NBS, who signed the letter firing Nilsen, said he had never been contacted by Russian authorities regarding the Barents Observer.  If the FSB were shown to have intervened for his sacking, it would not be the first time the Russian government had attacked Nilsens reporting work. In 2014 Mikhail Noskov, the Russian consul-general based in the Observers home town of Kirkenes, made a speech in which strongly criticised Nilsens writing and warned it may damage bilateral relations. Barents Observer is a mouthpiece for the Barents Secretariat, and is therefore in a way a vote for the official Norway. Then you should not distort facts and mention Vladimir Putin in such terms as you do, said Noskov. He did not respond to questions from the Guardian about the FSBs involvement in Nilsens sacking. Nilsen said he had long been fighting the Barents Secretariat for total independence between our owners and us as a newsdesk. He added that Noskov had visited the Barents Observer offices on several occasions to complain in person about their reporting. Frederic Hauge, president of the Bellona Foundation, an environment and human rights organisation with offices in Norway and Russia, said the alleged involvement of the Russian intelligence service was an escalation of what was already a serious matter of press freedom. What we are seeing here is at the best clumsy, maybe stupid. But I fear its also to silence voices. And thats really ugly, he said. [In Nilsen] we are losing an important voice form the north. The Barents Observer has been a very reliable, neutral source of information and that has probably provoked someone. He said Nilsens reliable, fact-based reporting on the oil industry was likely to have made him a target. Anyone who doesnt sing hallelujah for the oil industry in Norway is a kind of outlaw, he said. [State oil company Statoil] are the biggest threat to democracy in Norway, because they are so enormous. This is a nice little selfish country of petroholics. Statoil and Russian state oil company Rosneft have plans to cooperatively explore for oil offshore in the Arctic - however progress has been stalled due to European Union sanctions over Russias invasion of Ukraine. Maintaining good relations with Russia is considered vital to Norwegian interests. Russia reportedly houses a significant nuclear arsenal close to the Norwegian border and the two countries work together to store nuclear waste in the far north. The Norwegian government mantra for the Arctic, said Nilsen, was high north, low tension. Nilsen said he was working with the Norwegian journalists union to build a case for reinstatement. The fight is not over yet, he said. Note: The article has been amended to include a response from the head of the NBS."

Norways Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG), founded on the nations oil and gas resources and worth now 580bn in total, is being targeted by fossil fuel divestment campaigners.  The GPFG sold off its holdings in 53 coal companies in 2014, dumping 16 US companies including Peabody Energy and the mountain-top-removal companies Arch Coal and Alpha Natural Resources. The fund also dropped 13 Indian companies, including the giant Coal India.  But only three Chinese coal companies were removed from the funds portfolio and the total value of its coal holdings fell by only 5% to 6.5bn. On Friday, it was revealed that the funds stake in major oil and gas companies rose to 20bn in 2014. The GPFG divested from 53 coal companies, which is a third of the number of coal companies we found in the portfolio the year before, said Heffa Schuecking, director of the German NGO Urgewald, which did the analysis. While this is a laudable first step, the overall result is very disappointing as the GPFGs total investments in the coal industry show only a marginal decrease.  Truls Gulowsen of Greenpeace Norway said: We are happy to see that the GPFG divested 60m by dropping 13 Indian coal companies, but at the same time, it has increased its investments in the Chinese coal sector by 61m. Chinas coal consumption fell for the first time this century in 2014, helping to end the upward trend of global carbon emissions. Norways largest private pension fund KLP divested from coal in 2014 and Gulowsen said: It is shameful that Norways private pension funds are far more willing to take action on the coal issue than the GPFG. Investing oil proceeds into the coal industry is the worst possible use of our nations money. A series of analyses have shown existing coal, oil and gas reserves are several times the amount that can be burned whilst keeping global warming under the internationally agreed 2C limit. A recent study found 80% of coal reserves would have to be kept in the ground. Many senior figures and institutions in the financial world, including the World Bank, Bank of England, HSBC, Goldman Sachs and Standard and Poors, have warned that only a fraction of known fossil fuel reserves can be safely burned and that the remainder could plummet in value posing huge risks to investors. The Go Fossil Free divestment campaign received a significant boost on Sunday, when it received the support of the UN organisation in charge of global climate change negotiations.  We support divestment as it sends a signal to companies, especially coal companies, that the age of burn what you like, when you like cannot continue, said Nick Nuttall, the official spokesman for the UN framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC). We have lent our own moral authority as the UN to those groups or organisations who are divesting. The GPFG revealed in February that it had shed 32 coal companies due to concerns that environmental action would cut their value, but did not name those companies.  Arild Hermstad from the Future in Our Hands, Norways largest environmental organisation, said that in the lead-up to the crucial UN climate summit in Paris in December, Norways parliament had a unique chance to show what responsible investment means by excluding, coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel: The GPFGs coal investments are tiny in relationship to its total holdings, but the problems they cause around the world are huge."

Norways Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG), which rose to 531bn in total, revealed in February that it had shed 32 coal mining companies due to concerns that action on global warming would cut their value.  Analysis by the green NGO Future In Our Hands of official data released on Friday shows the fund holds financial stakes in 90 of the top 100 oil and gas companies, as ranked by the amount of carbon in their reserves.  The fund, founded on the nations oil and gas wealth and which receives new capital each year, increased its ownership of 59 of the 90 companies. Despite the oil price crash leading to losses of over 10% on the funds oil and gas sector investments, the new stocks bought meant its overall holding in the 90 companies rose by 1.3bn.  The fund did sell off its shares in two Canadian tar sands companies  MEG Energy and Canada Oil Sands  together worth over 50m. A series of analyses have shown that there are already several times more fossil fuels in proven reserves than can be burned if catastrophic global warming is to be avoided, as world leaders have pledged. Scientists say virtually all of Canadas tar sands oil must stay in the ground, if climate change is to be tackled.  Our pensions are increasingly being invested in oil and gas and this is a trend Norwegian politicians have a responsibility to stop, said Arild Hermstad, head of Future In Our Hands. The way the GPFG is behaving contradicts all established research on climate change.  Theres also a financial risk related to these investments, when we know that Europe, the US and China are heavily investing in renewable technology, said Hermstad. We expect renewable companies to gain better operating conditions in the time to come, and its a pity that the fund isnt picking up on this trend. Martin Norman, from Greenpeace Norway, said GPFG remained heavily invested in Canadian tar sands, with large stakes in Suncor and TransCanada, the company wishing to build the controversial Keystone XL pipeline across the US.  Given the poor recent performance of fossil fuel investments, Norman said: GPFGs investments in fossil fuels is not only an environmental problem, but it is starting to become an economic problem as well. We believe the politicians must give a clear mandate to GPFG to pull out of coal, tar sands and other fossil fuels. The funds investments are regulated by acts of parliament which have previously banned investing in weapons manufacturers and tobacco producers. However, WWF welcomed an updated statement from GPFG on what it expects of companies in relation to climate change. One requirement is that companies should work out future business scenarios, including ones in which international action to limit global warming to 2C leads to sharp cuts in carbon emissions. If other funds follow suit, this could be the start of the tipping point the world needs to stop financing polluting energy, and start financing a better world, said Samantha Smith, Leader, WWF Global Climate and Energy Initiative. ExxonMobil and Shell have said they do not believe the worlds governments will deliver deep cuts in carbon emissions.  Analysis of the funds coal investments is expected on Monday."

It usually refers to terrorists who are not members of an organisation, but are self-starters inspired by a cause. In fact, they are usually part of small networks of like-minded individuals, perpetrating acts of violence that elicit the support of larger numbers of people. Most of the Islamist lone wolves, like the killers of Lee Rigby, conform to this model. But Anders Breivik, who slaughtered 77 of his fellow Norwegians on 22 July 2011, really was a loner, a singularly murderous ideologue who emerged from self-imposed isolation. However, as sne Seierstad shows in One of Us, her meticulous account of the Oslo and Utya massacres, Breivik did not come from nowhere. First of all, he was a product of a short-lived relationship and two parents who were ill-suited to parenting. His father was a diplomat who had four children from a string of marriages and didnt stay in contact with any of them. His mother was a neurotic who couldnt cope with her two children. Breivik was very nearly taken into care at an early age, but administrative loopholes led to him staying with his mother. He grew up an alienated and socially awkward child who unsuccessfully tried to find an identity on the Oslo streets as a teenage tagger, a graffiti artist who went by the name of Morg. Rejected for being uncool, he reinvented himself as a salesman, making a tidy living flogging fake diplomas, until the authorities closed him down. He also joined the anti-immigration Progress party, intent on becoming a politician. But as with everything he tried, his personality got in the way, and once again he was rejected. Even the Belarusian mail order bride he ordered didnt work out. He thought she was a gold-digger and she was sent back home. Thereafter Breivik moved back in with his mother and dedicated himself to computer games. He spent five years playing World of Warcraft up to 18 hours a day, scarcely leaving his room. Despite becoming a proficient participant, what let him down again was his angry personality, which he couldnt conceal, even on the internet. In the end, no one wanted to play with him. From computer games he migrated, without leaving his bedroom chair, to ultra-nationalist and anti-Islamic websites. Here, with minimal interaction with the outside world, he honed his paranoid ideology. He became convinced that Europe was imperilled by a combination of Muslim immigration and cultural Marxism. So he hatched a plan to build a bomb and attack not just the Labour government but also the next generation of Norwegian political leaders in its youth wing, the Workers Youth League (AUF). This is where the lines between the fantasy of World of Warcraft and the reality of benign Norway got catastrophically blurred in Breiviks mind. He persuaded himself that he was the leader of a secret order of knights poised to lead a revolt across Europe. He withdrew to a remote farm and cooked up a massive homemade bomb. He found his country neighbours uncouth. In his diary, between detailing his homicidal plans, he described himself as a refined individual dressed in very expensive brand clothing. It was if he was channelling Patrick Bateman from American Psycho. Almost as soon as he exploded the bomb outside the Norwegian parliament, killing eight people, Breivik could and should have been apprehended. A passer-by took down the make and number plate of his car, and gave an accurate description to the police. But he made his way to the AUFs summer camp on the lake island of Utya untroubled by law enforcers. Despite its bloody crime fiction, Norway has strong claim to be the most peaceful place on Earth. Its police were therefore clueless about how to respond to a terrorist attack. They met the crisis with an incompetence that bordered on the criminal.

From then on, he lived almost entirely in his imagination, but his fantasies were still linked to the real world of politics and ideology. Breivik became obsessed with the idea that the west was at war with Islam. Inspired by&#xa0;websites, such as Robert Spencer<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>s Jihad Watch, or the Neo-Nazi Stormfront, books by the US journalist Bruce Bawer, speeches by the Dutch politician <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/geert-wilders"" title="""">Geert Wilders</a>, or a Norwegian blogger, named Fjordman, Breivik transformed himself into a character in&#xa0;cyberspace called Andrew Berwick.</p> <p>As Berwick, he wrote a long manifesto entitled <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><c5><93>2083: A European Declaration of Independence<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><c2><9d>, full of bellicose talk, cobbled together from his favourite websites, about the need to save western civilisation from being conquered by Islam.</p> <p>In fact, however, Muslims were not&#xa0;the main targets of Berwick<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>s war, in which he dreamed of martyrdom and murder.

But before they could marry, Nadereh, at the age of 17, ran off to Iran with her neighbour, Ahmad.</p> <p>Nadereh<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s father was an elder in their village, and her daughter<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s escape was seen as a great shame for the family.

They fled to Norway, where they applied for asylum in September 2010, four months before Zahra was born.</p> <p>In Norway, the stricter immigration policies have triggered a major political dispute, mostly about refugee children with long-term ties to Norway. In 2014, 79 children who had lived in the country for four years or more were deported. The majority were sent to Afghanistan and Nigeria, the governments of which recently agreed to open up for returning refugees.</p> <p>According to Norwegian law, the welfare of the child, including his or her connection to Norway, has to be a central factor in determining asylum cases. But Ketil Krohn Ven<c3><83><c2><a5>s, a lawyer who represented the Hashemi family, said that in several cases, including that of Nadereh and Ahmad, the children<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s wellbeing has been outweighed by attempts to regulate migration.</p> <p>Deportations surged dramatically from September to November, possibly in an attempt to reach the <a href=""http://www.norwaypost.no/index.php/component/content/article/30606"">government<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s stated goal</a> of returning 7,100 rejected asylum seekers in 2014.

As they were escorted to a car that would take them to a holding facility at Oslo airport, four-year-old Zahra shouted: I am not Afghan, I am Norwegian. The next evening, the family was on a plane to Kabul. It was a very dark day, said Ahmad. A very bad day. Under a policy introduced by the centre-right coalition government that came to power in late 2013, Norway now deport families with children. Last year, according to Norwegian police, the country forcibly deported 649 children, 84 of them to Afghanistan. The deportations have met staunch resistance from civil society advocates, who accuse the government of violating international rights conventions. Recently, the Afghan government also put its foot down. On 10 February, Afghan authorities at Kabul airport refused entry to a woman who had been deported from Norway with two children, citing the womans poor health and the absence of a male family member. The womans husband had escaped before Norwegian police could deport him. It was not the first time the Afghan government had balked at the harsher Norwegian policies. In November, the Afghan foreign ministry sent a letter to the Norwegian embassy in Kabul, threatening to refuse to accept returning families if deportation rates did not drop. The problem arises when so many are deported against their will, particularly when so many of them are women and children, Ghulam Murtaza Rasooli, legal director at the Afghan ministry of refugees and repatriation, told the Norwegian daily Bergens Tidende in January. The letter was sent six days before the Hashemi family was deported. However, the deportations have continued. Jran Kallmyr, of the anti-immigration Progress party and state secretary for the Norwegian justice minister, said: It is not very unusual for countries who receive deported people to complain. The Guardian has followed the Hashemi family for two months, as they attempt to settle into their new life in Afghanistan, a country none of the children had seen before setting foot there in November. On their arrival, the government offered the family a temporary place at a guesthouse for returnees. Residents there warned Ahmad that returning families face danger as they are often rumoured to have made a lot of money abroad. I was afraid that my children would be kidnapped, Ahmad said. Instead, the family, who are Hazaras, settled in Kabuls predominantly Shia neighbourhood of Chendawol, where an imam let them stay in a small room at the back of a mosque. In late January, they moved a block away, to a smaller room. It had mouldy walls and a gas burner was the sole source of heat for the night, when temperatures in the winter drop well below zero. This is hell. This is not a country. People die here every day. I don't want my father, mother, brother or sister to die While Ahmad searches for work in the day, Nadereh and the children spend their time in the room, afraid to venture outside. This is hell. This is not a country. People die here every day, said Meisam, 11. I dont want to see my father or mother die, or lose my brother or sister. In a corner of the room, a small backpack belonging to six-year-old Mohammad is packed and ready to be taken back to school. Between blankets on the floor, Zahra, aged four, fiddles with a teddy bearing a Turkish Airlines logo. When talking to each other, the children speak in Norwegian. The parents have not yet had the heart to tell Mohammad and Zahra that they have left Norway for good. We tell them that the plane is broken and just needs to be fixed, said Nadereh. They tell other children they meet in the mosque that they are going to take them to Norway, to show them their room. Since arriving in Kabul, Mohammad has suffered from ear pains, and a stomach ache that makes it difficult for him to keep food down. His siblings regularly cough and seem lethargic. In Afghanistan, medication is notoriously unreliable, and a financial burden.  According to Norways justice ministry, the Oslo government gives $10-20,000 (6,455-12,910) to families who return to Afghanistan voluntarily, but only about $500 a person when they are returned by force. With both parents currently unable to provide for the children, that money is only enough to eke out a basic life. Ahmad occasionally finds work as a daily labourer on construction sites, for which he gets paid 350 afghani (4). The monthly rent on their room is 2,000 afghani. Richard Danziger, the chief of mission for the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) in Kabul, says that while any country has the right to deport or reject asylum seekers, deporting families to Afghanistan requires very careful consideration at present: Economic and educational opportunities are limited and decent housing is scarce. Equally, the security situation has seen some deterioration over the last few weeks and we are in the middle of a harsh winter. Kallmyr, however, said that if Norway were to give asylum to families because they were poor and not in need of political protection, there would be millions of potential asylum seekers that we would then be obligated to give asylum. He added that a life in Kabul was better for children than being confined to an asylum centre in Norway. We have a lot of children living in asylum centres, and thats not a very good condition for children to live in, he said. The Hashemi family did claim asylum on protection grounds. But the persecution they claim to face is personal, not political. It was not possible to verify their claims, but what the couple told the Guardian is consistent with documents from Norwegian asylum authorities. The heart of Nadereh and Ahmads story is, apparently, a tale of forbidden love. They grew up in Wardak, a conflict-ridden province west of Kabul. Nadereh came from a violent home with a father who, when she was nine, promised her to an older cousin. But before they could marry, Nadereh, at the age of 17, ran off to Iran with her neighbour, Ahmad. Naderehs father was an elder in their village, and her daughters escape was seen as a great shame for the family. Her brothers vowed to track down Ahmad and kill him. Eight years after Nadereh and Ahmad had settled in Tehran, people in the community one day warned them that a couple of men had been asking about them. I dont know how they found us, said Nadereh, who was then pregnant with Zahra. They fled to Norway, where they applied for asylum in September 2010, four months before Zahra was born. In Norway, the stricter immigration policies have triggered a major political dispute, mostly about refugee children with long-term ties to Norway. In 2014, 79 children who had lived in the country for four years or more were deported. The majority were sent to Afghanistan and Nigeria, the governments of which recently agreed to open up for returning refugees. According to Norwegian law, the welfare of the child, including his or her connection to Norway, has to be a central factor in determining asylum cases. But Ketil Krohn Vens, a lawyer who represented the Hashemi family, said that in several cases, including that of Nadereh and Ahmad, the childrens wellbeing has been outweighed by attempts to regulate migration. Deportations surged dramatically from September to November, possibly in an attempt to reach the governments stated goal of returning 7,100 rejected asylum seekers in 2014. According to Norwegian police, a total of 7,259 people were deported in 2014, including 438 to Afghanistan. The governments goal for 2015 is to forcibly return 7,800 people. Kallmyr said the increase was merely making up for the neglect of previous governments. We cant have a system where children are used by their parents to get permission to stay in Norway, he said. This week, Vens will bring Nadereh and her familys case to court in Oslo, asking for their asylum claim to be reconsidered. He will claim that the Norwegian government has violated the UN convention on the rights of the child and the European convention on human rights. The children are Norwegian, they cant live like this, Vens said."

During the day they line the city streets here, holding out little cardboard cups. At night they retreat to their worn-out, overcrowded box vans  ageing, rusty vehicles that might contain six people sleeping. They park wherever they can, sometimes in the middle of well-established housing areas, until they are asked to leave by neighbours or the local police. But there are plenty of Norwegian-born homeless too, if more hidden from view. The majority of these are single mothers, victims of violence in the home. A fifth are 18-25 years old, half are addicted to drugs or alcohol, and 40% suffer from psychiatric illnesses. Most find a place to stay at night thanks to private shelters and NGOs, but some sleep on the streets and in doorways. Others go to noisy hostels paid for by the municipalities, where they stay warm but attract drug and alcohol pushers who only make the problem worse. Many Norwegians are uncomfortable with this alternative urban reality  and for the past year, our politicians have been discussing whether to save us from these embarrassing sights by introducing a law that bans street begging altogether. The two parties that originally proposed the idea (The Conservatives and Progress) came to power last autumn, and in January 2015, with the help of Centre party, they proposed a nationwide ban.  Media outlets around the world picked up on the story: Norways dirty little secret, one of the worlds richest nations becoming so mean. The coalition government stood steadfast, but the Centre party got cold feet. Just a couple of days after proposing the ban, they withdrew it  despite having included a ban in their party manifestos for the 2009 and 2013 elections.  Half a century ago, of course, Norway was one of Europes poorest countries, with people spending an average of 40% of their household budget on food. In 2013, having long reaped the rewards of striking oil, the IMF ranked only Luxembourg as richer in (nominal) GDP per capita than Norway, with Qatar a close third. Yet despite this wealth, 75,000 Norwegian-born children lived below the poverty line in 2012. As the oil money flowed in, so the cost of living soared, and those without jobs cant keep up. To give a rough sense of how expensive it is to live in Norway, the July 2014 Big Mac Index (in which the cost of a McDonalds hamburger in the US is the benchmark) had Norway at +62%. The UK was -8%. But the dearest expense in Norway, by far, is housing  so its no surprise that homelessness is growing. With 244 homeless people, Sandnes is the Norwegian city with the worst problem proportionally: 3.6 homeless people per 1,000 residents. The city is just 10 miles from Norways oil capital, Stavanger  driving from Sandnes to Stavanger, you pass the headquarters of Statoil, the national oil company.

In a recent Norwegian <a href=""http://www.nrk.no/nordland/sier-ja-til-isbiter-fra-svartisen-1.12268959"">news story</a>, Olsen says Svaice plans on beginning its operations this spring.

Miriam Jackson, a research scientist at the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate, says that compared to the amount of ice Svartisen is currently losing each year due to warming, harvesting somewhere in the range of 3,600 cubic meters of ice (4,000 cubic metres of water) is <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c5><93>negligible<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c2><9d>. On balance, Jackson says that Vestre Svartisen grew during the late 1980s and 1990s, meaning that it gained more size in the winter than it lost during summer melt.

That makes ice cube extraction seem insignificant.</p> <p> There are other environmental impacts to Svaice<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>s plan, of course. One would have to account for the energy put toward shipping the ice to Dubai, New York or wherever else the demand for opulent ice exists. </p> <p> Moreover, some are simply bothered by the conceit: <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c5><93>This is not a resource that the world needs in its drinks,<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c2><9d> Enge says.</p> <p> On the other hand, Jason Box, professor in glaciology at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, says glacial ice cubes might serve a helpful role by making consumers think about the purity and fleeting nature of glaciers. </p> <p><c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c5><93>The proposed venture would have people cherishing the aesthetic of ice,<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c2><9d> Box says. <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c5><93>The way even small pieces of glacier ice floats in a glass resemble identically the shape and form of icebergs; that fractal geometry of nature floating in your whisky glass is aesthetically far more pleasing than artificial ice.<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c2><9d></p> <p> Besides, he notes, mining ice cubes from glaciers on the scale that Svaice is proposing would be tiny compared to the environmental impact of most extractive and energy-intensive industries, such as aluminum production. </p> <aside class=""element element-rich-link element--thumbnail""> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/mar/25/sustainability-eco-green-natural-buzzwords-greenwashing"">'Sustainability': is it a dirty word?</a> </p> </aside>  <p> On its website, Svaice defends its proposal by saying it will power its equipment with biofuel and use green electricity produced at the local hydroelectric plant (powered by glacial runoff). Besides, they add, the ice they<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>ll be taking would otherwise melt soon anyway.</p> <h2><strong>Will people pay for artisan ice?</strong></h2> <p> In a <a href=""http://www.svaice.com/watch-our-video/"">promotional video</a> featuring two men clad in Nordic sweaters, using crampons and carrying antique ice axes, Svaice casts glacial ice collection as an important tradition for generations of villagers living around the glacier. These intrepid men would <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c5><93>travel by foot across the wild and tough land to collect the ice. A wedding or special dinner occasion was not complete without the ice. This made the party perfect, and memorable<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c2><9d>.

In the mid-1980s, Jim Harper owned a freight forwarding company, AK-Pacific, which shipped perishables between Seattle and ports in Alaska. Together with his friend Tim Dimond, based in Juneau, Harper wanted to test a theory that consumers would pay big bucks for glacial ice. </p> <p> </p> <p> At the time, bottled water was just beginning to emerge as a niche consumer product, and companies in the Great White North started bottling glacier water. (This trend was short-lived, according to the International Bottled Water Association, and nearly all bottled water sold today is filtered municipal water or from a spring.)</p> <p> One of these startups began shipping a chunk of glacial ice <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><80><9c> to be used as a merchandizing prop <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><80><9c> along with its products to the Lower 48, according to an article in <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/02/us/alaska-journal-marketing-glacier-ice-is-a-hot-new-industry.html"">The New York Times</a>.

The product itself was free.</p> <h2>Turning glacial ice into profit</h2> <p> They started selling 3kg (7lb) bags of glacial ice cubes to grocery stores in Seattle, which garnered some attention and international press. That led to a phone call from a Japanese company that wanted to import the glacial ice as a luxury item. At that point, the Dimond Ice Company was on fire.The forward-thinking entrepreneur cornered the market. </p> <p> <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c5><93>We had strong demand for the ice from Japan, and we didn<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>t want anything to happen that would keep us from operating,<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c2><9d> Harper said. A permit to harvest glacial ice didn<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2>t exist, so state officials had to figure out what it would and would not allow. Authorities conducted an environmental review and held public meetings. There were some local objections to adding a new industry to the sensitive marine environment and concerns that removing the ice would cause the coastal waters to warm. But in the end, the permit was granted. </p> <p> By then, many other businesses were keen to mold glacial ice into profits. Harper contended that all this interest made the state rethink what it had done. <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c5><93>They got nervous and said, <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><cb><9c>wait a minute.<c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><84><a2><c3><a2><e2><82><ac><c2><9d> </p> <p>No other permits were issued. (Harper and Dimond have held on to theirs, and say they could restart the Dimond Ice Company by simply paying a fee to renew the permit.)</p> <p> The permit required that only floating ice that had already calved off a glacier be harvested. The permit also placed a ceiling on how much ice the operation could take, but Harper said they never came close to meeting it <c3><a2><e2><82><ac><e2><80><9c> and they were taking more than three times the amount Svaice says it will harvest.

On the other hand, Jason Box, professor in glaciology at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, says glacial ice cubes might serve a helpful role by making consumers think about the purity and fleeting nature of glaciers.  The proposed venture would have people cherishing the aesthetic of ice, Box says. The way even small pieces of glacier ice floats in a glass resemble identically the shape and form of icebergs; that fractal geometry of nature floating in your whisky glass is aesthetically far more pleasing than artificial ice.  Besides, he notes, mining ice cubes from glaciers on the scale that Svaice is proposing would be tiny compared to the environmental impact of most extractive and energy-intensive industries, such as aluminum production.   Related: 'Sustainability': is it a dirty word?   On its website, Svaice defends its proposal by saying it will power its equipment with biofuel and use green electricity produced at the local hydroelectric plant (powered by glacial runoff). Besides, they add, the ice theyll be taking would otherwise melt soon anyway.  In a promotional video featuring two men clad in Nordic sweaters, using crampons and carrying antique ice axes, Svaice casts glacial ice collection as an important tradition for generations of villagers living around the glacier. These intrepid men would travel by foot across the wild and tough land to collect the ice. A wedding or special dinner occasion was not complete without the ice. This made the party perfect, and memorable. Now, the narrator concludes, we are bringing the exclusive and prestigious ice to you.  Geir Jrgensen, high-north advisor to the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature, grew up in Glomfjord and says the video is ridiculous. In Norway we have no such tradition at all, he says. But this video makes me laugh.     If it starts production, Svaice will not be the first modern-day enterprise to harvest glacial ice and market it as a premium product. In the mid-1980s, Jim Harper owned a freight forwarding company, AK-Pacific, which shipped perishables between Seattle and ports in Alaska. Together with his friend Tim Dimond, based in Juneau, Harper wanted to test a theory that consumers would pay big bucks for glacial ice.     At the time, bottled water was just beginning to emerge as a niche consumer product, and companies in the Great White North started bottling glacier water. (This trend was short-lived, according to the International Bottled Water Association, and nearly all bottled water sold today is filtered municipal water or from a spring.)  One of these startups began shipping a chunk of glacial ice  to be used as a merchandizing prop  along with its products to the Lower 48, according to an article in The New York Times. So why not start selling the ice itself?   Related: Antarctic ice shelves are melting dramatically, study finds  For Harper and Dimond, it was a no brainer: they could use the ice to fill empty southbound ships, and their only costs were from collecting and moving the ice. The product itself was free.  They started selling 3kg (7lb) bags of glacial ice cubes to grocery stores in Seattle, which garnered some attention and international press. That led to a phone call from a Japanese company that wanted to import the glacial ice as a luxury item. At that point, the Dimond Ice Company was on fire.The forward-thinking entrepreneur cornered the market.   We had strong demand for the ice from Japan, and we didnt want anything to happen that would keep us from operating, Harper said. A permit to harvest glacial ice didnt exist, so state officials had to figure out what it would and would not allow. Authorities conducted an environmental review and held public meetings. There were some local objections to adding a new industry to the sensitive marine environment and concerns that removing the ice would cause the coastal waters to warm. But in the end, the permit was granted.   By then, many other businesses were keen to mold glacial ice into profits. Harper contended that all this interest made the state rethink what it had done. They got nervous and said, wait a minute.  No other permits were issued. (Harper and Dimond have held on to theirs, and say they could restart the Dimond Ice Company by simply paying a fee to renew the permit.)  The permit required that only floating ice that had already calved off a glacier be harvested. The permit also placed a ceiling on how much ice the operation could take, but Harper said they never came close to meeting it  and they were taking more than three times the amount Svaice says it will harvest. They were also taking a very healthy profit.  Related: Will Gadd: 'We were climbing ice that isnt going to be there next week'   Our customer was selling the ice in 1kg packages, which contained three ice cubes, for $8, Harper recalls. It was a pretty spendy thing,  It was also short-lived. The Japanese economy went soft, Dimond Ice Company lost its overseas client, and the enterprise was more or less over three years after it started.  Harper, who keeps up on his ice industry news, has been hearing the buzz about the Svaice project. His reaction? How are the Norwegians getting away with this? Everyone is crying about the glaciers melting."

Since then, however, the oil price has more than halved, gouging a hole in Norways economy and forcing the Scandinavian airline SAS to cancel its six flights a week from Stavanger to Houston. As a consequence of reduced activity in the oil industry, SAS has experienced a severe decrease in demand and thus passenger loads on the Stavanger-Houston route. Hence, SAS no longer has sound commercial grounds for continuing this niche route, the airline said in a statement. When the route started in August 2014, it was aimed at connecting two huge oil markets at a time when the price of crude was $98 a barrel. Now the price is barely $45. The German airline Lufthansa scrapped direct flights between Stavanger and Frankfurt this summer, and Air France ceased direct flights from Paris in May. The collapse in the oil price has hit Norways economy, which is predicted to grow by little more than 1% this year despite record low interest rates. Around 50% of Norways export income comes from oil, which accounts for 20% of investment.  The effect on Stavanger, Norways fourth largest city, has been pronounced. One in three jobs, around 43,000, are directly or indirectly related to oil and gas in the area. Thousands of jobs have already been lost, and house prices are sliding  only 16 properties were sold in the city this summer, according to a housing market survey by Samfunnskonomisk Analyse.  Related: Oil price crash threatens the future of the North Sea oilfields  Stavanger is an exporter of oil technology and oil-related equipment. According to one estimate, there are 150 Norwegian firms in the Houston area, and 12,000 Norwegians live in or around the Texan city. Norways investment in oil and gas will decline by more than 30% over the next two years, according to ystein Drum, chief economist at DNB Markets, a financial services group. DNB expects the oil price will pick up to around $65 in 2016, and $70 in 2017, stabilising at between $60 and $80 a barrel. This will provide a skewed hit to the Norwegian economy  we expect to see a much weaker development in labour and housing markets in western Norway, particularly in Stavanger. But we do not predict a decline in the economy overall, Drum said. The SAS flight to Houston is the longest by a Boeing 737 aircraft, lasting more than 10 hours.

All three were workers at the Karranga Station in Scadden, north of Esperance. A local man also died. Briton Tom Butcher, 31, died as he tried to save his girlfriends horse from the huge fire near the town of Esperance, his employer told the Australian newspaper. A mechanic who was planning to buy a house with his girlfriend after moving to Australia four years ago, he had been living in the town for the past year. I spoke to him on Friday evening and his last words to me were Im living the dream mate, Im living the dream, his sister, Jess Greenaway, told WA Today. Tom had a heart of gold and he would do anything for anyone. His girlfriend, Leila Vadnjal, wrote on Facebook that she didnt go an hour without talking to him. She described Butcher as her hero. Feeling lost is an understatement, she wrote. I told you every day I need a cuddle and today I need it most. The other victims were named as Anna Winther, 29, from Norway, and Julia Kohrs-Lichte, 19, from Germany.  Their employer, Linda Campbell, told the Australian newspaper that she and Butcher thought there was enough time for him to leave the Campbells farm with Winther and Kohrs-Lichte and drive towards Esperance to drop off the horse at Vadnjals stables. Campbell said she had suggested her daughter go with the other three, but she had opted to stay at the farm. The homestead was undamaged. The local man who died, Kym Freddy Curnow, 45, has been hailed as a hero for trying to stop the trio and others driving into danger. But they and Curnow were overwhelmed by smoke a few kilometres from the farm, apparently after heeding Curnows warning for them to turn around but failing to outrun the rapidly moving fire. Curnow had stopped several cars driving into the blaze in the Grass Patch and Salmon Gums areas, north of Esperance, on Tuesday. It is believed Winther and Kohrs-Lichte had arrived to work on the farm only two weeks ago. Perths Curtin university said Winther had graduated with a masters degree in human rights last year. She is believed to have been working for Amnesty International, with one of her colleagues, Amelia Freelander, tweeting; Very sad to hear that Amnesty Activist Anna Winther was one of 4 to perish in the #EsperanceFires. Curnows friend Glen Quinlivan held back tears talking about the Scadden farmer on Thursday. We were full tilt in our fire truck, trying to get away from it and only just made it, he told reporters. Anyone who was behind us had no chance. Its not about heroics, its just you do what youve got to do, and he did what he had to do. Guy Green, whose family lost farms, machinery and houses, said his life would never be the same without Curnow. Not all heroes wear capes or a suit, he wrote on Facebook. Weve all lost a great mate and to us younger boys a father figure. You were much more than a hero and risked your life doing what you always did. Western Australian premier, Colin Barnett, said the deaths were tragic. Foreign nationals who came to Australia to work and have a good time, and tragically and sadly, theyve lost their life, he said. About 135,000 hectares have been burnt by the fire and the alert level remained at watch and act on Thursday evening. The Bureau of Meteorology said temperatures would gradually rise on Saturday and thunderstorms could form on Sunday."

The six-volume autobiographical novel by the Norwegian writer Karl Ove Knausgaard, with its highly personal voice and frequent shifts between memoir and essay, was something no play could do justice to. My first thought was that its impossible. Theres no way, he said. The novel, and the amount of thoughts and reflections in it, was too huge. My second thought was, Id like to give it a try. My Struggle is Scandinavias most celebrated literary work this decade and a bestseller, selling one copy for every nine inhabitants in Tandbergs native Norway. Increasingly it is also winning admirers internationally, with the author lionised on his tour to the US earlier this year. Norways own national theatre spent a year trying to adapt it, but abandoned the project. Tandbergs success is largely thanks to his decision to do away with parts for the actors. Instead, two men and two women jog on to the stage, dressed as if they had just walked in off the street. They take turns speaking conversationally into a microphone to the audience, reading through Knausgaards description of himself writing in his Malm apartment, while the others look on and react with shame, embarrassment and laughter. At first it seems like a gimmick, with all four actors, including the women, somehow playing Knausgaard. But it works astonishingly well. Having a woman claiming that shes Karl Ove Knausgaard is really to say that this is authentic fiction, that this is not really truth, says Tandberg. It becomes evidently clear when there are four people claiming to be one person, that its not really true. The set is limited to four desks, four chairs, four typewriters, a few microphones and a huge grey boulder which looms throughout. The actors move fluidly between the fragments Tandberg has judiciously picked out of the text. He claims his rule in cutting down the books, a process which took several months, was to always keep an eye out for where the pain is the biggest in his writing, where is the place where the knife goes deepest [Knausgaard] is a very self-destructing man. I saw the whole project as a way for this author to find a way for himself to live. The cut version could have simply been a reduced Knausgaard (all 3,600 pages in only 150 minutes) and, indeed, on Thursday, thats what many had come to see. This seems to be a convenient way not to have to read the books, said sa, a woman in her early 30s. Everybody seems to have a quite strong view of this book, so you feel you have to read it, but the sheer volume is intimidating. Knausgaard is a talking point largely because of a stinging, intemperate article he wrote in response to a feminist attack in May, in which he damned the Swedes as a nation of narrow-minded Cyclopes, full of hate and fear, who cannot tolerate ambiguity, and as a result cannot enjoy or understand literature. A reprint of the article takes up more than half of the programme. Tandberg keeps the scenes which have most enraged feminists, notably Knausgaards claim to have been deprived of sexual potency at a baby rhythm class, or his anguish at having his productivity as an artist suffocated by gender-equal childcare. On stage, though, these scenes were met with laughter rather than disapproval. Indeed, one of the surprises of the production is how funny it is. The actors revel in slapstick depictions of teenage sexual fumbling, premature ejaculation, or loosening a stubborn stool with a finger. Sex is kind of fun on stage and impotence is even funnier.

After its run in Stockholm, Tandberg is hoping to take the play to wherever the novels have had an impact, starting with the rest of Scandinavia, then the US and possibly the UK.  This article was amended on 7 September 2015. An earlier version said that the play was all 3,600 pages of My Struggle in only 200, rather than 150, minutes."

And the city is just the highest profile in a series of major urban areas that have made bold moves in recent weeks, ridding themselves of fossil fuel investments and becoming more carbon friendly. Leichardt, Australia voted to completely divest from fossil fuels within three years, while Byron Bay announced the decision to commit to zero emissions. Smaller US cities have already gotten on board in various ways, while last week in London, the GLA passed a motion asking the mayor to approve pulling City Halls pension fund out of all fossil fuel holdings. The list of cities that have divested appears set to grow ever longer. But does Oslos decision really mean much, given that Norways own pension fund  the gigantic Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG)  continues to invest in fossil fuels? Is the momentum behind municipal divestment as unstoppable as it seems? And is divestment something that should, or could, be emulated by bigger cities like London?  Erik Lae Solberg, Oslos vice mayor for finance, admits his citys decision to sell 40m krone (3.3m) worth of coal investments in the Oslo Pension Fund isnt much. But it sends a signal, he says, that Oslo does not want to contribute to the most climate-damaging fossil fuels, and that the city has a wider goal to be climate-friendly. Weve seen that coal is clearly the energy source that is most harmful, Solberg said. Its been said that the cities of the world contribute about 70% of carbon emissions. So clearly the cities of the world are an important part of the problem of climate change. In 2011, the council set a goal to reduce the citys greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030, and be climate-neutral by 2050. To do so, it has set out an array of measures, from 258 municipal electric-car charging stations, to recycling household waste for bio-fuel to power the citys buses. Still, it is a conundrum for Norway, a major producer of oil (and, to a lesser extent, coal), which channels its excess petroleum revenues into its own pension fund. The government has so far resisted parliamentary calls for Norways 5.5tn krone (470bn) nest egg, GPFG  the worlds largest sovereign wealth fund  to divest from fossil fuel. A government-appointed panel recently recommended that the fund not divest from fossil fuels, but rather set up a new climate-related exclusion criterion on a case-by-case basis. It concluded:  Energy production constitutes an important basis for our society, and fossil fuels  both petroleum and coal  will remain part of the mix for decades to come, the report concluded in December. The question is thus not whether investors will own these companies, but which investors are good owners of these assets from a financial and ethical perspective. The giant Norwegian fund held at least 316.7bn (26.8bn) krone in oil, gas and coal investments in 2014, according to NGOs Urgewald and Future in Our Hands. It did divest from 52 coal companies last year, but Urgewald says it actually ended up increasing the value of its coal holdings, from 82.2bn krone in 2013 to 85.7bn krone last year. It wasnt Norways cities which led the charge to divest, however. The divestment movement here has its roots in the small community of Eid, population 6,000, whose mayor Alfred Bjrlo took up the cause with its pension fund manager more than two years ago, after he was inspired by a city in the US. It was towards the end of 2012 when, by chance, I read about the Seattle mayors plans to pull out of all coal funds, said Bjrlo. I thought if a city like Seattle could do something like this, then it is fully possible in Norway. It was indeed Seattle that was the first US city to join the Fossil Free divestment campaign led by 350.org. Mayor Mike McGinn announced in December 2012 that Seattle would not invest any of its $1.4bn operating cashflow in fossil fuel companies, and would seek to divest its $1.9bn pension fund and $700m deferred compensation plan. Whether the worlds megacities will follows suit is another question entirely. Last weeks vote to call on the mayor to divest Londonss 2bn GLA Group Investment Syndicate from fossil fuel investments, as well as to ask the chair of the 4.8bm portfolio London Pension Fund Authority (LPFA) to commit to divestment, falls on Boris Johnson  whose office pointed out what it considered the drawbacks. The mayor takes climate change extremely seriously, a spokesperson said, adding that the mayors office believed a sudden divestment on Londons part from fossil fuel investments would cause a huge disruption to the world economy, let alone the retirement plans for millions of UK residents. There was, the spokesperson said, a realism that there needs to be transition away from fossil fuel and not a sudden cliff-edge.  Danielle Paffard, a campaigner for Fossil Free UK divestment, calls Johnson a fossil fuel head and is less than optimistic. But she says that with mayoral elections next year, the issue of divestment could become a big part of the debate. In the meantime, Fossil Free has set its sights on encouraging some European cities, such as Amsterdam, Berlin and Stockholm, to divest. Her US colleague, Amy Miller, points to the progress being made in states such as Massachusetts, which just received the support of the local Great Barrington Select Board; the Minneapolis City Council, which will vote on the issue next week; and great strides being made in Washington DC and her hometown of New York City, which sits on a $160bn pension fund (a very big goal, Miller says).  Whether New York is any more likely than London to divest, however, is up in the air, she says. City politicians remain concerned about the possible financial impact of divesting. They prefer to remain investors, and to influence through active engagement, she said. But it just doesnt work. Are you asking [these fossil fuel companies] to leave 80% in the ground?"

The exhibition rightly provides a forcible reminder, but no one will be surprised. The situation is different for Munch, however well known the Scream, with its russet sky, may be. One of the merits of the show is to reveal the extent and variety of his experiments. Some of the works bear no resemblance to what was going on at the time. In 1907 he did a painting entitled Cupid and Psyche, in which a man and a woman face one another nude. Long strokes of colour <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> green, purple, red <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> run down their bodies.

But <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><c5><93>behind<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><c2><9d> suggests that there is space in this canvas: in fact there is none. The sense of oppression and confrontation are all in the surface of the painting.</p> <p>No one else was painting like this in 1907, not even <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Br%C3%BCcke"">Die Br<c3><83><c6><92><c3><82><c2><bc>cke</a>, a group of young German expressionists led by Kirchner and Heckel. In 1905 they had laid claim to both Van Gogh and Munch as sources of common inspiration. Indeed, a snowy landscape by Munch from this period could be by Van Gogh, much as the Dutchman<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>s Sower might be the work of the Norwegian. Sometimes the connection seems so obvious it must be deliberate: Munch<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>s Starry Night of 1922-24 is a tribute to his fellow<c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><84><a2>s Starry Night over the Rhone of 1888. There are striking similarities in some of their portraits too: the same composition, tight close-up view, disregard for any seductive charm, the same preference for tired faces, bony features with sunken eyes. Which brings us back to our starting point, the determination to strip bare the human condition, that of the painter with savage self-portraits and, just as brutally, that of his fellows.</p> <p>In 1908 Munch defined painting as a means of representing a powerful emotional state simply working from nature <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> or rather after nature seen under the influence of that powerful emotional state.

The exhibition rightly provides a forcible reminder, but no one will be surprised. The situation is different for Munch, however well known the Scream, with its russet sky, may be. One of the merits of the show is to reveal the extent and variety of his experiments. Some of the works bear no resemblance to what was going on at the time. In 1907 he did a painting entitled Cupid and Psyche, in which a man and a woman face one another nude. Long strokes of colour  green, purple, red  run down their bodies. Other equally assertive strokes criss-cross behind them. But behind suggests that there is space in this canvas: in fact there is none. The sense of oppression and confrontation are all in the surface of the painting. No one else was painting like this in 1907, not even Die Brcke, a group of young German expressionists led by Kirchner and Heckel. In 1905 they had laid claim to both Van Gogh and Munch as sources of common inspiration. Indeed, a snowy landscape by Munch from this period could be by Van Gogh, much as the Dutchmans Sower might be the work of the Norwegian. Sometimes the connection seems so obvious it must be deliberate: Munchs Starry Night of 1922-24 is a tribute to his fellows Starry Night over the Rhone of 1888. There are striking similarities in some of their portraits too: the same composition, tight close-up view, disregard for any seductive charm, the same preference for tired faces, bony features with sunken eyes. Which brings us back to our starting point, the determination to strip bare the human condition, that of the painter with savage self-portraits and, just as brutally, that of his fellows. In 1908 Munch defined painting as a means of representing a powerful emotional state simply working from nature  or rather after nature seen under the influence of that powerful emotional state. Much as for Van Gogh painting was a terrible trial for the nerves. Van Gogh + Munch is at the Munch Museet, Oslo, until 6 September, then at the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, until 17 January 2016 This article appeared in Guardian Weekly, which incorporates material from Le Monde"

After news of the burial, which was conducted by his wife Jean, Kasems daughter Kerri posted on Facebook: This morning my family and I learned that my Dads abusive wife Jean Thompson Kasem and their daughter Liberty conned a cemetery in Norway into burying my Dad there. She added that her father had made it clear that he wished to be buried in the United States. Kerri Kasem, who is one of Kasems adult children from his first marriage, and Jean Kasem, who was married to him for more than 30 years, fought over who had the right to care for the DJ in the last months of his life. The battle ultimately ended in court with Jean Kasem claiming his children were attempting to prematurely end their fathers life. On Monday, Kerri Kasems publicist, Danny Deraney, said: Clearly the family is not happy and they understand that Jean can bury him wherever she wants, even if it is not what Casey wanted. But the kids are at peace knowing that they got their Dads final moments.

Raheem Sterling, Jack Wilshere, Danny Welbeck, the matchwinner Wayne Rooney, and Roy Hodgson will be pleased with themselves tonight. But not as pleased as the 49,819 people who stayed away. Updated at 9.58pm BST  9.53pm BST 90 min +3: Lambert nearly hooks a ball down the left to release Welbeck, who has been very lively since hes come on. Nothing doing, though. You know its a boring game when even ITVs Andy Townsend has nothing insightful to say, writes Ben Wilkie, offering the best late-night satire, ladies and gentlemen, since the BBC took TW3 off the airwaves.  9.51pm BST 90 min +2: The impressive Sterling wins a corner down the left. Bainess set piece is met by Lambert, who heads back across goal, but theres nobody there to bundle home.  9.51pm BST 90 min +1: There will be four added minutes of this. The first minute feels like four minutes, just like so many before it.  9.50pm BST 90 min: Sturridge is replaced by Lambert.  9.49pm BST 89 min: Flo wins a corner down the left. England clear a piss-poor set piece. Welbeck feeds Sterling down the right. Milner is in acres in the middle. Sterling finds him with a crossfield pass. Milners shot is deflected wide left, giving England the opportunity to work a piss-poor corner of their own. That should have been 2-0.  9.47pm BST 87 min: Former Blackburn star Morten Gamst Pedersen comes on for Jenssen. As a fan of Borussia Moenchengladbach, begins Carl Foulkes, I am pleased to see Hvard Nordtveit, our third-choice defensive midfielder, giving an accomplished display at centre back against such top quality attacking talent.  9.44pm BST 84 min: Cahill is replaced by Jagielka. Time for the armband to move on once again. This means the new England captain is  the bloke who cleans the Wembley toilets  Joe Hart.  9.42pm BST 82 min: Jones concedes a corner down the left, under pressure from Kamara. Ah hold on, the referees given a very generous free kick to England. It doesnt really matter, though, does it. A total silence descends on Wembley.  9.40pm BST 81 min: Another substitution, another debut:Chambers comes on for Stones. Meanwhile Ben Culling is of the opinion that, should they lose, Norway have a ready-made excuse: Norway will shortly be changing their kit as they cant make each other out against the seats.  9.37pm BST 78 min: Welbeck and Sturridge bustle away down the right. Sterling pulls the ball back for Henderson, who connects on the edge of the D and scores three in rugby. Norway make another change: Tarik Elyounoussi is replaced by Kamara.  9.36pm BST 77 min: Stones wins a corner down the right. Before the set piece can be taken, Norway replace King with Nielsen. The corners then taken, and Jones sends a lame header well wide right. He runs off wearing one of his trademark grimaces that has Internet Meme written all over it.  9.35pm BST 76 min: Sturridge, on the edge of the Norway box, slides a clever pass down the inside-left channel to release the livewire Welbeck. The new Arsenal striker lashes a low cross through the six-yard box. Theres nobody there to poke home.  9.34pm BST 75 min: Cahill is now Englands captain, by the way. For what thats worth.  9.33pm BST 73 min: A reasonably instant impact by Welbeck, who powers down the inside-right channel, takes a touch to the right as he enters the area, and lashes a shot towards the top right. Nyland, the effort travelling at pace and on target, does well to parry clear.  9.32pm BST 72 min: That was a timely goal for England, because the home side were labouring to such an extent that they were making the retired Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard, much maligned in their active years, look like Jozsef Bozsik and Nandor Hidegkuti.  9.30pm BST 70 min: Thats Rooneys last contribution tonight. Hes replaced by Welbeck, while Oxlade-Chamberlain and Wilshere are traded for Milner and Delph, the latter making his debut. Norway also make a switch, Skjelbred swapped for Mohamed Elyounoussi. (The one already on the field is his cousin Tarik.)  9.27pm BST The England captain lashes the ball into the top left. Nyland isnt saving that. A fine penalty! Updated at 10.07pm BST  9.26pm BST 67 min: Sterling takes the ball into the Norway area down the left. He toe-pokes the ball forward and zips past Elabdellaoui, who panics, lunges in, and takes the winger down! Updated at 10.06pm BST  9.25pm BST 64 min: Forren clatters into Sturridge as the two challenge for a high ball. Thats opened up a cut on the back of the strikers noggin. Spray, plus vaseline, stems the flow of claret. Hell be fine to continue.  9.22pm BST 63 min: Ah hold on, there were some more numbers. Tonights attendance is 40,181. Thats not much better, is it?  9.21pm BST 62 min: Tonights attendance is 40.  9.21pm BST 60 min: Sturridge, from a standing start, attempts to burst past Nordtveit and into the Norwegian area down the left. He doesnt speed off with any conviction, though, and tries to win either a corner or a penalty, going down near the byline under pressure from the defender, who has recovered and is behind him. He wins neither.  9.19pm BST 59 min: Hodgson comes to the touchline to do a bit more frowning. But hes taken his hand off his mouth (52 mins) and is now shouting quite a lot. Oxlade-Chamberlain makes good down the right and wins a corner, which is wasted. Baby steps, though, and thats a bit better from England.  9.18pm BST 58 min: King chases after a Drillo-style hoick down the middle, and very nearly gets a toe to the ball before Hart comes to the edge of his box to claim. England are a complete shambles right now!  9.16pm BST 56 min: Daehli goes down, his studs catching in the turf and twisting his knee as he chases after Sterling. It doesnt look as though the lad will be able to continue. Ice packs are being applied. Hell be loaded onto a stretcher. That looks very unpleasant. God speed young Mats Mller. Hes replaced by Konradsen.  9.14pm BST 53 min: Cahill gets himself in all sorts of bother down the Norway left, falling over as he attempts a backpass. King tears off towards the area with the ball. He zips past Jones, and on the left-hand edge of the six-yard box, tries to chip Hart instead of pulling back to Daehli for a tap-in. Hart parries. Lucky England.  9.12pm BST 52 min: England have yet to come out for the half. Hodgson is sitting on the bench frowning, with a hand covering his mouth. He looks highly depressed. Positive energy, Roy, send it out.  9.10pm BST 50 min: Yep, its slow all right. Jenssen flicks the free kick into the area from the right. Henderson is forced to eyebrow the ball over the bar. From the set piece on the left, King meets the ball with his head, six yards out, and batters a header towards the top right. Its going in, but Hart fingertips brilliantly away for another corner, from which nothing comes. A fine header, and a superlative save.  9.08pm BST 48 min: Elabdellaoui powers down the right wing and nearly feeds Daehli on the overlap. Then another phase of play, and Daehli is upended by Baines as he looks to cut inside from a wide position. A free kick just to the right of Englands area. A slow start to the half by the hosts, this.  9.06pm BST And were off again! No changes, which is slightly surprising given this is a friendly. Switzerland and Italy loom large in the qualifiers for these two, I suppose. Norway get the ball rolling again. And theyre quickly on the attack, Daehli dropping a shoulder and skinning Baines, before wheeching a low cross into the six-yard box. Hart smothers.  8.54pm BST Half-time entertainment: Given the first 45 minutes, this is one of the few occasions some stark Nordic folk music might actually raise the pulse.  8.49pm BST Hmm. Look on the bright side, at least not too many folk are wasting their hard-earned on this.  8.49pm BST 45 min +1: Skjelbred in a bit of space down the right. He skelps a fairly aimless cross into the box. Hart makes a nine-course tasting menu of gathering the high ball, which floats near his crossbar, and nearly fumbles it into the goal! He finally claims after some dangerous Harlem Globetrotters style ball-spinning, and has the audacity to remain poker faced after distributing the ball upfield. A puff of the cheeks or a roll of the eyes was the bare minimum requirement there.  8.45pm BST 44 min: Sturridge, Sterling and Rooney get involved in some over-elaborate nonsense on the left-hand edge of the Norwegian box. For a second the ball looks like breaking to Sterling, affording him time for a shot. But Norway hack clear. Theyre looking fairly comfortable at the back, for all Englands probing.  8.43pm BST 41 min: Wilshere is having a very impressive game. First his pass from the centre circle straight down the middle nearly sends Sturridge racing clear, but Forren comes across just in time to clear. Then, as England launch another attack, he breaks into the Norway area and falls nipples first to the turf, chasing the ball. He goes over the prone Nordtveit, who has slid in early. No contact, and no penalty. Dangerous looking forward burst, though.  8.40pm BST 39 min: King spins Cahill brilliantly down the left wing, zips inside, and slides a ball into the England area for Daehli. Baines has been tracking his man, though, and gets in the way, ushering the ball back to Hart. England were very nearly opened up there. Ive often thought that transferring the Barmy Army from cricket to football would be win-win, suggests Marie Meyer.  8.38pm BST 36 min: England are enjoying a drinks break. The habits they picked up in Manaus! Ah, hold on, heres why plays stopped: Linnes looks like hes injured. Hell be replaced by Diego Forlan lookalike Per Egil Flo, the latest member of the clan to make the international grade, after Havard, Jostein and Tore Andre.  8.34pm BST 33 min: A little bit of noise now as Stones makes good down the right and sends a fast-paced looper towards the far post. Sturridge and then Sterling nearly manage to control, but the pass is simply too hot. Goal kick, out on the left of goal. The right idea by Stones, though.  8.33pm BST 32 min: Its almost completely silent at Wembley. Updated at 8.58pm BST  8.32pm BST 31 min: Linnes whips a fine ball into the England area from the left. Cahill once again deals with the problem, though this time there were opponents lurking. Better from Norway, though its not much for them to write home about.  8.31pm BST 29 min: Elyounoussi stands on Bainess foot as the pair slide towards a ball down the Norway right. It could have been a booking, but its just a free kick. Baines nearly gets immediate revenge by cutting into the Norway box from the left and having a dig towards the bottom right. But Nordtveit slides in to cushion the shot, rather bravely, with his legs splayed open and his fruitbowl seriously at risk. Thats got to hurt. Corner. Cahill clumps a poor effort wide left from the resulting set piece.  8.28pm BST 27 min: Jenssen is in a little bit of space down the left. He teases a low cross into the England area, but theres no red shirts thataway, and Cahill blooters clear with confidence. Norway are showing very little as an attacking force.  8.26pm BST 25 min: Sterling is an astonishingly good footballer. Hes on the halfway line, to the left of the centre circle, and sprays a delightful diagonal pass upfield to release Sturridge into the area down the channel on the right. Nyland comes out to make life awkward. Sturridge meets the bouncing ball and attempts to lob home, but the effort rests on the top of the goal netting. Nowhere near going in, really, but what a pass.  8.25pm BST 24 min: Wilshere releases Baines down the left twice in 15 seconds or so. From the first pass, Baines finds Sturridge just inside the box on the left. He hits a snapshot thats easily blocked. From the second pass, a dismal cross thats blocked by Elabdellaoui. Lovely playmaking by Wilshere.  8.22pm BST 22 min: Norway launch it long, the spirit of Egil Olsen very much alive. Jones heads clear weakly, and from a position 25 yards out down the inside left, Elyounoussi attempts to stroke a curling volley into the bottom-right corner. Hart smothers with ease, there being little pace on the ball.  8.21pm BST 20 min: Norway are finding it difficult to retain possession. England are in charge, though it should be noted that Nyland hasnt actually had to make any saves yet. Couldnt the FA and their broadcast partners insert computer-generated fans in the empty seats as convincingly as they overlay those annoying Vauxhall ads next to the goals? wonders Aram Gyan, who for all I know works in the marketing department of a major automotive manufacturer based in Dagenham.  8.17pm BST 17 min: Wilshere lifts a fine pass down the inside-right channel, nearly releasing Oxlade-Chamberlain into the area. Jenssen tracks back to concede a corner. From the set piece, Jones flashes a header wide right of goal from a position 12 yards out, level with the left-hand post. Decent enough, all of that. England are on top here. Updated at 8.58pm BST  8.16pm BST 15 min: A lovely little backheel by Sterling, on the right-hand edge of the Norway box, sends Sturridge into space. The striker takes a touch inside and looks to curl one into the bottom left, but his effort is quickly blocked. Shame. That was a lovely move.  8.14pm BST 12 min: Henderson rakes a ball down the inside right for Rooney, who battles with Nordtveit and plants his forearm on the Norwegians jaw. Or was it his nose? Im watching in 108dpi low definition. Thank God the England band got tickets at least, eh? asks Elliot Carr-Barnsley. Yes, hooray for the England band. Were 60,000 middle-aged spreads down tonight, so theres nothing to soak up the sound. Its like an echo chamber. Theyre twice as loud and ten times as annoying, according to the reading on the Guardians official vuvuzelaometer.  8.11pm BST 10 min: Crosses into the area at both ends, both from the right wing. Daehli for Norway first, then Oxlade-Chamberlain for the hosts. King and Rooney try to get their heads on the ball, respectively, but theres no real danger.  8.10pm BST 7 min: Elyounoussi runs at Stones down the left. Cahill comes across to cover. England fly up the other end. Sterling thinks about skittering down the left, and is stopped pretty much at source.   8.06pm BST 5 min: Sturridge glides in from the right and has a shot from the edge of the area thats blocked. From the loose ball, Henderson is clapped to the floor 25 yards out, in a central position. Baines goes for the top-left corner, and scores three rugby points. I hope thats not gone into the top tier of the stand, it might take hours to fish out the ball from the void.  8.04pm BST 3 min: A little sashay by Sterling, and he feeds Oxlade-Chamberlain down the inside right. Jenssen clips him in full flight. The free kick, in the middle of the Norway half, is passed backwards. Sticking a big centre back into a full back position where small fast wingers have plenty of space to get some pace up and run at them is a great way to ruin their confidence and set them back a few years, opines Ben Wilkinson. Im very glad weve stopped doing that with Phil Jones. Sadly it seems were starting it up with John Stones. Does the career of Jamie Carragher prove or disprove this argument? I cant work it out.  8.02pm BST 2 min: Scrub that about the atmosphere, it was a rogue pre-match roar. Perhaps someone was coming down the stairs carrying coffees for everyone. England knock it around a bit, getting a feel for the ball.  8.01pm BST To be fair to the few brave souls who have bothered to turn up, there was a rare old roar after the anthems were respectfully observed. As atmospheres go, its not exactly Brazil versus Uruguay at the 1950 World Cup, but its better than perhaps could be expected. And were off! England get the ball rolling.  7.56pm BST The teams are out! England in their famous white, Norway in beautiful red. Time for a blast of the de facto Norwegian national anthem, Yes We Love This Country. Yes, we love this country / As it rises forth / Rugged, weathered, above the sea / With thousands of homes. A beautiful mix of the romantic and the practical, like an advert for paint. Lets give the English one the bodyswerve, we all know it anyway.  7.32pm BST England, who give Everton defender John Stones his first start: Hart, Stones, Jones, Cahill, Baines, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Henderson, Wilshere, Sterling, Rooney, Sturridge.Subs: Forster, Rose, Jagielka, Chambers, Milner, Delph, Townsend, Welbeck, Lambert.  Norway: Nyland, Elabdellaoui, Nordtveit, Forren, Linnes, Skjelbred, Johansen, Jenssen, Daehli, King, Tarik Elyounoussi.Subs: Jarstein, Semb Berge, Hagen, Flo, Samuelsen, Pedersen, Konradsen, Nielsen, Tettey, Mohamed Elyounoussi, Kamara, Hansen. Referee: Jorge Sousa (Porto). Updated at 7.51pm BST  7.15pm BST Roy is right, of course: the days of England thrashing Norway have long since passed. England won the first encounter between the two countries, at the Ullevaal Stadion in Oslo in May 1937, resoundingly. They came away with a 6-0 victory, though slightly piqued at the absence of the King of Norway and the Crown Prince. It was the first Norway international with no royal in attendance. That they couldnt be bothered was fair enough: the prince was gadding around in London, while the king was on the razz in Denmark, where their kings silver jubilee celebrations were in full swing. The chance to see Wilf Copping strut his stuff had little comparative appeal. That was followed by a 4-0 win at Newcastle Uniteds St James Park in 1938, a 4-1 win at the Ullevaal in 1949, and a famous 6-1 in Oslo in 1966, Jimmy Greaves scoring four ahead of what would no doubt be another personal triumph at the World Cup. England won 4-0 at Wembley in 1980 in the qualifiers for Espaa 82, but events at the Ullevaal the following September changed the relationship entirely. Norway beat England for the first time in six attempts, 2-1, and Bjrge Lillelien came out with some famous commentary that has subsequently taken one hell of a milking. File alongside Sgt Pepper, the dead parrot sketch, David Brents dance, and Kind of Blue: brilliant, but oh so played. Since then, Norway have had the better of things. A 1-1 draw at Wembley in 1992, a match prefaced by some trademark Gazza diplomacy: Fuck off Norway! A 2-0 win for Norway in 1993, which jiggered both Graham Taylors reputation and Englands USA 94 hopes. A couple of goalless friendly draws in 1994 and 1995. And a 1-0 win for England two years ago, Hodgsons first match, Ashley Young settling matters at the Ullevaal. Expect another tight match tonight, then. England are hardly the footballing behemoth of Wilf Coppings day, with confidence low after the events of the summer. Their captain Wayne Rooney is a bit chubby, according to Norway defender Vegard Forren. And Norways young 19-year-old winger Mats Mller Dhli, of Cardiff City, arrives with a growing reputation. Whether he can out-Sterling the similarly youthful and absurdly talented Raheem is another matter, mind you. It could be a very interesting night. Its on! Does anybody have a spare ticket? Updated at 8.19pm BST  2.43pm BST The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results  Albert Einstein (or Rita Mae Brown, or Benjamin Disraeli, or Roy Keane, take your pick). Your aim has got to be: Were going to plan well, were going to work well, were going to set up well, were going to give the players as much confidence as we can give them, and were in this tournament to win it. Unfortunately, thats how we approached the World Cup and it didnt get us very far. But lets hope, next time, itll get us further, because our plans and our procedure and our aims wont change  Roy Hodgson. 40,000  Attendance expected at Wembley tonight by FA. Its Englands first match of a new international cycle, the Euro 2016 qualifiers looming large, and its fair to say the country isnt consumed by football fever. Understandable, since Englands showing at the World Cup just gone was their worst since 1958, and fans these days are being asked to celebrate goalless draws with Costa Rica. Our boys will go out against Norway and no matter how well prepared we get them and however keen they are to do well, they wont find it easy, promises the England manager. Will we go out and thrash Norway? No I dont think we will. What a showman. Hes almost certainly right, of course, but paying punters should be allowed to keep hold of their dreams of being lavishly entertained, no matter how pie-in-the-sky, at least until kick off and the full horror of the real world begins to unfold. At least give them that. Youve spotted a possible cause-and-effect dynamic here, havent you. Kick off: 8pm in London, 9pm in Oslo. Updated at 7.00pm BST"

An unprecedented number of migrants are risking their lives to reach Europe, with 59,880 migrants arriving in Italy so far this year, nearly equalling the total number of arrivals in 2011, according to the Italian interior ministry.

The Manchester United striker scored his 41st goal for his country, a second-half penalty, to defeat a stubborn Norway team and hoist himself above Michael Owen into outright fourth place on the all-time England scorers list. He did so in front of the lowest crowd for an England match at Wembley, 40,181, since it was re-opened in 2007. The hosts dominated possession but laboured for long periods despite securing a first win in six matches, with Rooney conceding they all could have done better. Hodgson was prickly through his post-match media duties and was particularly infuriated when it was pointed out his team had mustered only two shots on target: the penalty and a shot from the substitute Danny Welbeck, which was saved by Orjan Haskjold Nyland. Dont give me that one, he said. Two shots on target? What about all the ones they threw themselves in front of, or the near misses? Dont hit me with statistics. When we had that much possession, and you talk about two shots on target? Were not scoring a lot of goals at the moment but were not playing against teams who come out against us a lot. This team will score goals. Theyll score goals. Rooney will score goals. Welbeck will score goals. [Daniel] Sturridge will score goals. [Raheem] Sterling will score goals. Switzerland will need to beat us. If anything, we might be Norway on Monday. We might be pushed back and wont be able to attack and dominate for long periods, as we did tonight. I dont know. But it might be the case. I dont think the mindset of the Swiss team, playing us in Basel, will be the same as the mindset of the Norwegians today. Yet, while patience will be required with his inexperienced lineup, there remain serious doubts over the partnership between Rooney and Sturridge. The latter arguably appeared more comfortable playing alongside Welbeck and with the excellent Sterling switched to a central No10 role over the latter stages. The new captains performance was rather peripheral, reflecting his form for his club, with England struggling for long periods to offer much encouragement to those who had attended the friendly fixture. In the first half we moved the ball quite well, said Rooney, who converted the penalty awarded when Omar Elabdellaoui tripped Sterling. The second half we started really sloppily, which was disappointing, but we got the win in the end. The young players in the team will learn. Were all still learning. Raheem Sterling is a threat, he gets at players. It doesnt always come off but hes an exciting player to watch. We all could have done better, but its a night where it was important to win. Hodgson, asked about his captains display and whether he may consider playing Welbeck alongside Sturridge instead in Basel, said: The fact is it was a big night for Wayne, with a lot of responsibility weighing on his shoulders, not least with the penalty, which he knew he had to score to secure the win. Its early days. If every time we play Ive either got to praise a player to the skies or criticise a player and say a partnership is not going to work, thats a bit harsh. Wayne will tell you he can play better than that. Of course he can. We know what kind of player he is. But youre not always going to give the best performance and you dont become a bad player if you dont put in the performance you wanted. I thought the performance was quite good. I was pleased with the first half, when we probed well and had good movement. I was disappointed with the start of the second half when we didnt do anything like as well for the first 15 minutes, but then we changed things, changed the formation slightly, and finished the game strongly. Yes, I was happy with Danny Welbeck and he was very lively when he came on. And when Sterling moved into the centre he showed the full range of his dribbling ability, so its nice to know we have these options and wont be totally restricted to one way of playing. Hodgson is confident Gary Cahill, who was substituted near the end and applied ice to an ankle, will be fit for the game against Switzerland  ranked ninth in the world to Englands 20th and Norways 53rd  with John Stones, on his first start, having suffered cramp late on. England will be without Jack Colback, however, after the Newcastle midfielder failed to recover from a calf problem and returned to Tyneside for treatment. Well find it hard to bring attendances back to a very high level because of the opponents were playing in qualifying  they wont be exciting the public, said Hodgson, with games against San Marino, Estonia, Slovenia, Lithuania and the Swiss ahead. Theyre not the kind of teams who normally attract full houses. But if my team works as hard as they did tonight, show the appetite and desire, the aggression in the defending, the exciting moves that were there for all to see, then the crowd arent foolish. They know what theyre seeing. Theyll come back to see Sterling, Sturridge and [Jack] Wilshere. These players have the potential to lead us forward and excite football crowds. Although I risk being in a group of one, I have been watching football for a long time and nothing you say will change what I see."

And, depressingly, on. But the ever present parp of Englands musical accompaniment was just about the only thing that remained from the guarded optimism of the last time England fans gathered at Wembley, when more than 83,000 had seen Roy Hodgsons men off to Brazil. The pre-match mood at a half-empty 757m national stadium that is one of the finest in the world but remains some way from having a team to match could not have been more different. Its top tier was cordoned off and tumbleweed blew down Olympic Way before the match. On the pitch, however, it felt like business as usual rather than the bright new dawn rather optimistically promised by the pre-publicity. Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard, whose presence together in midfield in that dead rubber against Costa Rica seemed to somehow symbolise the dashed hopes of the golden generation, were gone. But 4-4-2 was back. As were most of the players who failed in Brazil. Most worryingly, so too was the air of self-delusion that had been allowed to creep into Hodgsons Brazilian post-mortem. His programme notes referred, desperately, to the potential he had spied among his young charges in that dismal 0-0 draw against the already qualified Costa Ricans. And 15 of the 23 players selected by Hodgson had also been among those who were smuggled back into the country following their all too brief Brazilian sojourn. That number would have been higher still but for injuries. Never mind the much-derided corporate indifference  the 17,000 Club England seats that are so important to Wembleys business plan  there was a danger that the entire imposing bowl would echo to the sound of muted mumbling. In the end there was relief among the FA blazers that the attendance topped the 40,000 mark by 181 fans, but it remained the lowest figure since the new Wembley opened seven years ago. If there were points for marketing effort then England would be world beaters rather than also-rans. Englands players and manager were rolling out some of their best loved lines before a match that, ironically, had far more meaning than the last time the side pulled on their shirts in a World Cup tie. The manager, the captain, the Football Association, the rights holding broadcaster, the official sponsors, even the somewhat plaintive and redundant touts at the foot of the Wembley Park tube station steps  all were sticking to the script. Every Match Matters yelled the full page ads in the programme, as the FA tried to excite interest in not only Wednesday nights brave new world but the home qualifying matches against San Marino and Slovenia that will follow. A new dawn, a new day, a new England insisted ITV, desperately contemplating the prospect of having to go up against the Great British Bake Off with international footballs equivalent of a soggy bottom. The players were singing from the same hymn sheet before the match. Rooney spoke of a new chapter, Raheem Sterling said it was time to move on, Jordan Henderson promised they would step up. The tone from FA chairman Greg Dyke and Hodgson was one of respectful regret at the showing in Brazil followed by an insistence that things werent as bad as they seemed. But the new Wembley, that towering 90s monument to Cool Britannia excess  its huge banqueting halls, endless corporate boxes and iconic arch - not for the first time felt out of kilter with the downbeat fare on the pitch. Those ambling up to the office to buy a ticket at 5.30pm reported no queues and there was a funereal atmosphere on Wembley High Road. Inside, the PA announcer ran through his usual repertoire of bombastic introductions to nothing but silence. Yet easy as it is to poke fun at the endless expanses of red empty seats around Wembley, some context is required. It is always remarkable to leave the ground at midnight and hear the jumble of accents planning their journey home. For how much longer remains to be seen. Perhaps it might have made more sense to slash prices to a tenner, or let kids in for a quid. But any such scheme will never get off the drawing board in the FAs brainstorming sessions because of the need for Wembley to pay its way. The Club England managing director, Adrian Bevington, had spent the morning on Twitter trying to persuade fans not to give up on the national team. But in the process he admitted that the idea of taking England games away from Wembley, on which there are still 200m in loans outstanding, was a non-starter. We have to play games at Wembley to pay for the stadium and home games to meet broadcast contracts as well. So thats that then. England fans are nothing if not perverse, however, and there was a defiance about the determination with which the packed lower tier got behind their (not so) new look England side. Yet at half time there was a smattering of boos amid the rush to the bars. The ever-hopeful PA announcer tried to excite interest in winning a pair of front row tickets to the San Marino qualifier. Good luck with that. As the second half wore on, Hodgson sat slumped on the bench wearing the grimace that had become so familiar in Brazil. The atmosphere picked up after Rooney celebrated taking on the captains armband with a goal from the spot and those present resolved to enjoy themselves regardless  even if the biggest cheers of the night were reserved for the reviled Mexican wave.

The Olympiad involved 1,800 competitors from 174 countries, accompanied by more than 1,000 coaches, delegates and fans.

Meier is not the first player to die in the middle of a match; in 2000 Vladimir Bagirov, a Latvian grandmaster, had a fatal heart attack during a tournament in Finland, while in the same year, another Latvian, Aivars Gipslis, suffered a stroke while playing in Berlin from which he later died.

A favourite attraction for delegates was the now-legendary ""Bermuda party"", he added, hosted at each Olympiad by a member of the Bermudan delegation. The Olympiad was big news in Norway, with the state broadcaster, NRK, carrying hours of live coverage each day, and the country's government paying 87m kroner (8.5m) for the privilege of hosting the event. Last week the women's team from Burundi were disqualified after failing to show up for their round six and seven matches; they remain unaccounted for, Heitmann said on Friday.

The funds will improve forest governance, strengthen law enforcement, and support efforts in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, both governments said. West Africa is gripped by an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus that has claimed the lives of 2,917 people so far, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). Scientists have speculated that the crisis could have been driven by illegal logging that unleashed Ebola-infected fruit bats into contact with people, sending the outbreak out of control. Inhabitants in the region do indeed anecdotally report an exceptionally arid and prolonged dry season, perhaps linked to the extreme deforestation of the area over recent decades. At present, we can only speculate that these drier ecologic conditions somehow influence the number or proportion of Ebola virusinfected bats and/or the frequency of human contact with them, according to a study co-published in July by Daniel Bausch, associate professor of Tropical Medicine at Tulane University and Lara Schwarz of Canadas McGill University. On Tuesday a new study projected that Ebola could kill up to 1.4 million people by mid-January next year. Particularly at this difficult time, we are proud and happy to enter into this partnership with Norway, further consolidating our decision to embark on a green, sustainable development path, said Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. We have a tunnel vision right now focusing on the Ebola crisis. But Liberia has the largest remaining rainforest in west Africa. This deal helps a lot [to preserve the rainforest], said Axel Addy, Liberias minister of commerce and industry. Liberias government says its forests make up 43% of the Upper Guinea forests, which are a vital source of the earths carbon. This partnership holds promise not only for the forest and climate; but for forest communities that have been marginalised for generations. The partnerships commitment to respecting and protecting communities rights with respect to forests is laudable, said Silas Siakor, a Liberian environmental activist. The deal will see both sides contribute to sustainable development in Liberia through protecting natural forests, restoring degraded lands, and developing Liberias agricultural sector through enhancing sustainable agricultural management, and greening supply chains, according to a letter of intent signed by both countries. Residents and experts worry that the Ebola crisis could wreak havoc on West African economies, as quarantines prevent people from working. But Patrick Alley, director of Global Witness, said efforts to preserve Liberias forests could reap huge economic rewards. For decades Liberias forests have been more of a curse than a blessing. Timber revenues funded Charles Taylors regime during Liberias brutal civil war. Since then the experiment to generate economic development through industrial scale logging has failed, with logging companies routinely logging illegally, skirting taxes, and causing huge damage to forests and forest communities, Alley said. If Liberia delivers on this promise it could help spur the countrys economy and set development on a sustainable path at such a difficult time, he added. The negotiations on the partnership we launched today have been ongoing since long before the Ebola crisis, said Jens Frlich Holte, a political adviser to the Norwegian ministry of climate and environment. Of course, dealing with the [Ebola] crisis has to be the top priority."

Hodgson, as angry as at any time in his England tenure, spoke out in response to the reaction to the 1-0 defeat of Norway at Wembley and was particularly annoyed at having to answer a question about the fact his team had managed only two shots on target, describing the statistic as fucking bollocks. The England manager believes the disappointments of the summer have led to unfair analysis, adding to the negativity swirling around a team whose first game since the World Cup was played in front of a half-empty stadium, with their lowest crowd since Wembley reopened in 2007. Englands performance has led to scrutiny of Hodgsons decision to revert to a 4-4-2 system and the form of Wayne Rooney, who scored the decisive goal from the penalty spot but has started the season slowly. Hodgson believes the striker struggled with the pressures of being the teams new captain, something Louis van Gaal has also said at Manchester United, but the national team manager was still aggrieved about what he perceived to be undue negativity. I am entitled to [be annoyed], arent I? When you have questions like: You had only two shots on target  We cant get rid of the baggage, we cant change the fact we had a bad World Cup, we cant play those games against Italy and Uruguay again, but I think you will have to give me the entitlement at least. If we had played badly, if a lot of players had had really poor performances, if the quality of our passing and our movement was nothing like I wanted to see and if our defending wasnt as compact, aggressive and organised as it was for large periods, I would be the first to say so. But I am not going to say its not that, just because we had a bad World Cup. You have seen an England team dominate for 45 minutes against a good opponent. You have seen us work very hard to create chances, you have seen players get in behind defenders in wide areas and miss crosses and, yes, I am not terribly happy about that. I would have liked the crosses to be a little bit better. I would have liked two of three of those shots to get past the blocking player and whizz past the goal. I would have liked Daniel Sturridges magnificent effort, from that wonderful [Raheem Sterling] pass, not to land on the roof of the net. I saw a ten-to-15-minute period in the second half when I thought we were nowhere near what I wanted to see. I thought we lost the aggression in our defending and we didnt attack anywhere near as well. Joe had to make a good save from a corner, and Norway almost scored again from a Gary Cahill back pass. But we saw a different system then. We changed it around and I saw some very positive moments.

Henderson and Wilshere, in my book, were excellent. Delph came in to play his first game and showed some very good things going forward and, of course, Sturridge was excellent throughout. All Im saying is I want to judge every game as it is.

Now we have 40,000 to see us play against a much more difficult opponent. I cant put that right because I cant turn the clock back, but what I can do is analyse what I have seen and judge that through my eyes and not because someone is telling me: Well, you had only two shots at goal because, for me, that is absolute fucking bollocks, Im sorry. Hodgson, who has arranged for the psychiatrist Dr Steve Peters to talk to his squad  on Friday at St Georges Park as they prepare for Englands first Euro 2016 qualifier in Switzerland on Monday, went on to cite some of the players who were missing through injury. Jack Colback and Ben Foster have both had to withdraw from the original 22-man squad and Hodgson has decided not to bring in replacements before the team fly to Basel.

Anyone involved in policy formation in the Nordic country would probably have been baffled and even dismayed that an advanced democracy such as Australia couldve strayed so far from Norways stellar example on how to manage the dumb fortune of a resources boom. Norways government Pension Fund Global was created in 1990 to make the most of the windfall of striking oil in the North Sea. Companies looking to extract Norwegian oil pay handsomely for the privilege. The Norwegian government sums up the fund with the rather lengthy fortune cookie-like phrase One day the oil will run out, but the return on the fund will continue to benefit the Norwegian population. The bulging sovereign wealth fund, managed by the Norwegian government, is set to top $1trn within this decade. At the end of 2013, its value stood at 5.2trn kroner  thats $903.4bn. With the money invested more than 8,000 businesses and properties last year, the fund currently owns 1% of all the worlds stocks. The fund managers recently purchased a slab of Londons ritzy west end, including Savile Row, famed for its sharp suits and the former office of the record label Apple  the rooftop venue for the Beatles last live performance. The funds average annual return has been 5.7%. Last year was a bumper one, with the money pot swelling by 15%. Norways oil piggy bank is worth more than the GDP of Switzerland. More even than the US gargantuan annual military budget. In effect, Norway is a country of five million trustifarians  with each person theoretically being a millionaire (in kroner, that is). Such largesse invariably raises the challenge of how to spend the money. The government is limited to spending just 4% of the fund each year, with the rest hoarded for future disasters that may befall the Scandinavian country. Regardless, Norways publicly funded safety net is lavishly embroidered. Parental leave lasts 46 weeks at 100% of pay. Almost every child has access to childcare. Farmers are subsidised to the extent that they can keep cows in heated barns in the Arctic. Despite the relatively robust health of the Australian economy, there is no such opportunity for Scrooge McDuck behaviour, largely because of the botched way Australia has managed its once in a generation mining boom. In scrapping the mining tax, treasurer Joe Hockey called it a testament to a failed Labor government, failed economic policy, failed taxation policy and a failed treasurer. Tony Abbott called it a stupid tax. In many respects, Hockey and Abbott are onto something. In Norway, companies drilling for North Sea oil pay a 78% tax rate on income, compared with a corporate tax rate of 28%. By contrast, the much-derided Minerals Resource Rent Tax placed a 22.5% super profits tax on coal and iron ore producers. But the nature of the system meant that it raised very little money. Indeed, last financial year it raised nothing at all and was projected to bring in just $450m this year. This kind of flaw isnt that surprising when, uniquely among businesses, the mining companies were allowed to write their own tax code by a callow Labor government terrified of marauding mining magnates on the back of Utes. Where Hockey is on less firm ground is when he states the scrapping of the mining tax is a damn good deal. When you consider the Norwegian example, it seems farcical that parliament has spent the week squabbling over associated superannuation and childcare benefits when the obvious source of revenue was turned down for short-term political expediency and then abandoned entirely. This wasted opportunity extends to other areas. The outcry over changes to university fees, or welfare or payments to see the GP would surely be rendered unnecessary if the previous government had crafted a proper mining tax and spent it wisely. Its also to the detriment of Australias national intelligence that the idea of the mining tax as a jobs and growth-destroying handicap was given credence, all while being derided for raising no money. Norways GDP is set to grow by 2.7% this year, while Australias will grow by 2.5%. Both countries rode through the global financial crisis relatively unscathed. Unemployment and inflation has remained low in both countries, although they both have come under recent pressure in Australia and Norway, respectively. These results were similar even though Norway taxes its oil firms at 78% and Australias MRRT was 22.5%. There was no stampede of resource investment away from Norway due to its high tax rate, and it managed to insulate itself from any recession for coming generations to boot. Like Australia, Norway had an incoming conservative government last year. However, the language of the two governments appears to be from different planets, let alone ideologies. I would like to look into the budget to see if there are enough investments in education, research and infrastructure. And also the framework for small and medium sized enterprises, said Jan Tore Sanner, finance spokesman for the Norwegian Conservatives after the partys election victory. We really need to have strong investments not only in the petroleum industry but also in the other sectors of the economy. This couldve been the outcome for Australia, had there not been such a catastrophic failure in long-term thinking and such timidity in facing up to rent-seeking self interest."

For Norwegians, one of these occurred on the 23 June 1998. Most, if not all, will know where they were and who they were with when Norway beat Brazil 2-1 at the World Cup in France. In fact, some can even recite passages from Arne Scheies commentary. He is cold, like a fish was the line as Kjetil Rekdal stepped up to take the deciding penalty 10 minutes from time. Kick the ball into the Mediterranean for the last couple of minutes, Lars Tjaernas, the co-commentator, urged after the penalty went in. This being Egil Olsens Norway, it would not have been much of a departure from the original gameplan. Before Olsen took charge in 1990, Norway was a largely obscure footballing nation. This made sense, as it has a small population and a climate that is more suited to skiing than football. However, under him they suddenly started winning. As a player, Olsen had represented Norway under the management of the former Southampton inside forward George Curtis. His 1971-74 reign as Norways manager was a failure but Olsen the player was fascinated by his ideas. He was also deeply fascinated by the work of the retired RAF wing-commander Charles Reep, an English pioneer of statistical analysis and the long-ball game. Olsen combined ideas from the two: from Curtis the back four and zonal marking, from Reep the idea that moves with three passes or fewer were more likely to result in a goal. To this he added findings from his own studies at the Norwegian University of Sport and Physical Education. I discovered that it would appear that where the ball was on the pitch was just as important as who was in possession of it. To an extent that was in line with Reeps theories, that if you get the ball into the box as often as possible then you will win the game, Olsen explained in an interview with The Blizzard. Throughout the 90s, Olsens band of vikings repeatedly sacked more illustrious opponents  England, Italy, Holland, Brazil, Mexico and others among them. Norway twice ascended as high as second place in the Fifa rankings and qualified for consecutive World Cups in 1994 and 1998. Other countries had more technically gifted players, were more comfortable in possession, but through hard work and a fiendish devotion to Olsens plan, Norway prospered again and again. His plan became a national phenomenon. People with only a casual interest in football became familiar with his tactical concepts and Olsens way became Norways default tactic. His disciples would go on to dominate Norwegian football. When Olsen stepped down in 1998 he was succeeded by his assistant, Nils Johan Semb. Of the two squads Olsen had taken to World Cups almost every player became a coach, manager, administrator or prominent media voice in the Norwegian game. However, as with so many pioneers before him, the world caught up with Olsen and his ideas. In the 90s his Norway set new standards for defensive organisation, and their ultra-cynical, counterattacking tactic was unfamiliar to opponents. As football moved on, other countries developed both tactically and technically. Players became fitter and teams learned to cope with the Norwegian way  but rather than moving with the times, Norway stood still. We fell asleep, tightly wrapped in a duvet of self-aggrandisement and contentment, wrote Tjrnas , Olsens assistant at Wimbledon, in a brutal recent column for the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten. We were so pleased with ourselves, we thought the roughly 200 members of Fifa could come to us and learn. We lost a few years, and a generation, to those thoughts. It is no coincidence that very few technically gifted players emerged from the generation that grew up in a climate where anti-possession football ruled. Age Hareide, who played for Manchester City and Norwich in the early 80s, made tentative efforts to improve things between 2003 and 2008 but his reign as national manager was ultimately unsuccessful.

In 2013 Norway won three out of 13 games, two of them friendlies. In February they were 60th in the Fifa-rankings, an all-time low, but the relentless misery of the past few seasons did, if nothing else, impress upon the Norwegian FA the need to break away from the past. Per-Mathias Hogmo was hired as the manager and under him a new philosophy is slowly being implemented. The way we defend is a lot like Atltico Madrid, he explained in January, with 4-4-2 and an extreme movement of blocks. This demands a lot of us but this is what we want to do. And their new attacking game is, according to Hogmo, meant to be like the way Manchester City attack, almost in a 2-2-4-2. He also wants Norway to be proactive, to dictate their games. It is an ambitious concept but with only one win in his first 10 games (2-1 in a friendly against Moldova) there is more than a hint of emperors new clothes about this new dawn. It does, however, show that the FA finally accepts the need to move on from the outdated Olsen paradigm.

The competition, called Memorial Sites After 22 July, was won by Jonas Dahlberg, who will create three artworks at a cost of 27m Norwegian kroner (2.7m) to the government in Oslo. The most striking memorial is called Memory Wound. The 43-year-old artist has sliced a three-and-a-half-metre-wide slit into the Srbrten peninsula, which faces the island of Utya where Breivik killed 69 people. It marks a ""symbolic wound"" in the landscape. One hundred cubic metres of the stone cut from Srbrten will be transferred to the governmental quarter in Oslo, where another memorial will mark the spot where a car bomb was detonated by Breivik that resulted in eight deaths. A temporary pathway in the capital, between Grubbegata and Deichmanske library, will also be made by Dahlberg, who will later take trees from Srbrten to create a permanent amphitheatre in the government quarter called Time and Movement. Breivik, now serving a 21-year prison sentence, told an Oslo court in 2012 that his victims  many of whom were teenagers attending the Labour party's annual summer camp  were facilitating the ""Islamisation of Norway"". The jury for the competition, who reached a unanimous decision, included representatives of the Labour party and victim support groups. Dahlberg beat 300 other entries, including former Turner prize winner Jeremy Deller. Two memorials will be unveiled on 22 July 2015  the fourth anniversary of the attacks  with the amphitheatre to come at a later date. ""It is a big responsibility and in many ways the most important work I have done,"" Dahlberg told the Guardian. ""I was already honoured to be considered when I was invited to be in the competition, so to have won now is a bit hard to grasp."" The Swedish artist, who lives and works in Stockholm, said he hoped the memorial would provide a state of reflection through its ""poetic rupture"". He said: ""It should be difficult to see the inherent beauty of the setting, without also experiencing a sense of loss. It is this sense of loss that will physically activate the site."" The headland of the Srbrten memorial will be engraved with names of all the victims; visitors will be able to read them but not reach to touch them. ""People will find their own way through the landscape around the cut,"" said Dahlberg, ""looking down at the channel and at the victims' names from high up, or looking out to Utya, establishing their own private ways of seeing and remembering."" Mari Aaby West of the Norwegian Labour party youth league and John Hestnes, of the national support group for victims of the 22 July attacks, had passed on positive feedback from victims' families who had viewed the designs, said Dahlberg, who did not speak directly to the relatives. A statement from the jury for Public Art Norway, which included West and Hestnes, said Dahlberg's idea to make a physical incision in the landscape stood like a ""symbolic wound"". It said: ""The void that is created evokes the sense of sudden loss combined with the long-term missing and remembrance of those who perished. The proposal is radical and brave, and evokes the tragic events in a physical and direct manner."" Designs for two memorials in the government quarter are not finalised, but Dahlberg explained his temporary pathway would lie beside an existing walkway, taking pedestrians off their usual path. ""The design physically relates to the interruption that occurred in the everyday life flow of Norwegian society,"" he said. ""Yet it is indeed everyday life that must carry on."" Breivik received the maximum sentence available under Norwegian law. His prison term will be reviewed every two years after he completes a decade in jail."

I was told it was 14C, I say. Well, a friend told me it was just nine, he replies, adjusting his underwear. Shivering, we settle for 11  about average for an icy plunge pool  before sprinting back to the sauna as my feet go numb in the sand. Its the opening weekend of SALT, a year-long arts festival in remote northern Norway. Consisting of a series of striking architectural structures (including the worlds largest sauna, naturally), a site-specific art installation and a programme of contemporary music, the project is almost as dramatic as the landscape that surrounds it. We travelled for almost two years around the north of Norway looking for the right place for the festival, co-founder Helga-Marie Nordby tells me. But it wasnt until we came here ... She pauses. Well ... its special. Although the island can be reached by a long drive over bridges, pine forests and fjords, you get a better sense of its remoteness and ruggedness if you arrive by boat from Bod, capital of Nordland county. As you turn into the bay, the festival site comes into view: three giant triangular prisms made of wood stand on the clean, white sand beneath a looming cliff. You see contemporary art all over the world, but this kind of scenery, not so often, says Nordby, who wants the festival to create an awareness of the regions history, present and future. If you bring something humanmade into that scenery, its not just about nature, but about our role in that landscape. Nordby conceived the idea for SALT, which she founded along with cultural entrepreneur Erlend Mogrd-Larsen, in 2010 while the pair were curating the Lofoten International Art Festival. In many ways SALT functions more as a venue than a festival. On weekends throughout the year, monthly and bi-monthly events will take place, ranging from classical concerts and lectures to club nights and theatre performances. The sauna, bar and restaurant will be open throughout, and visitors can come for the day from the mainland, rent a cabin on the beach, or camp for free. After its stint in Norway, SALT will move on to Greenland, Iceland, Scotland and Alaska, where location-specific installations will be commissioned. The pyramids on Sandhornya are designed by Finnish architect Sami Rintala, based on the traditional fish-drying racks of the region. The largest is currently home to an installation by Chinese artist Yang Fudong, who has produced a series of haunting films that show local dancers drifting like spirits around the island. Yangs work  if it survives the winter storms  will stay on the site for six months, and after that will be replaced by a new commission. Sitting cross-legged, drawing spirals in the sand with his finger, Yang, who has spent a month living and working on the island, explains through an interpreter that the instant he landed there all his plans for the installation changed. I had imagined true peace in the past, he says. But when I moved on to the island, it was the first time I had experienced it in reality. Yangs sentiments seem to be unanimously shared by all the visitors I speak to, who are scattered around the beach, investigating the structures, watching Yangs films, or lying in the sand. Children are climbing up the wooden frames to get a better view of the performances, and smoke drifts out of the top of the sauna, which is warming up for the evening. Behind the stage two young girls in Scandi jumpers are selling torrfisk  dried cod  from a stand made from old wood with a hand-drawn sign. The wizened fish is hammered with a mallet to soften it so you can pull it off in strips to eat. I buy some (it tastes like fishy polystyrene, but is pretty satisfying to gnaw on) and walk over to the concert venue, where a violist and cellist from the Arctic Philharmonic Orchestra are creating conceptual classical sound waves with their bows. Other acts in the largely alternative line up that weekend included Lonnie Holley, an African-American artist who grew up in poverty in Birmingham, Alabama in the 1950s  his found-object sculptures and warbling atmospheric blues have won him worldwide acclaim  and Biosphere, a Norwegian electronic musician known for his Arctic-inspired ambient techno. While admiring the concert venue, I bump into one of its builders, Tomas. We built that in 19 hours, he says proudly, clenching his biceps through his thermal jacket. Now feel this. When night falls, the festival takes on even more Norwegian earthiness. Theres a bonfire, but, having come slightly underprepared for the cold that evening, I head to the amphisauna to warm up properly. I sip on a warm beer (with a polar bear on the can) in the prism-like oven, which can fit up to 120 people and has a huge triangular window at the front so you can look out over the beach. With a bar at the back and deep house music pumping, it feels more like a club than a sauna, the only difference being that rather than cooling off in the smoking area, people dash into the sea instead. As the weekend draws to a close those still on the island are treated to a sight that outdoes both the art and the landscape. In the early hours, during the short period when the horizon is in total darkness, an unusually strong display of northern lights  surprising even the locals  dances in the sky. Eventually I retire for the night. Im staying in a mobile home called a njalla, designed by artist and architect Joar Nango, which sits on wooden skis that allow you to drag it to a spot of your choosing. Inside is a woodburning stove and a bed consisting of reindeer pelt on a surprisingly comfortable layer of dry branches. I look up through its glass ceiling, drifting off as the northern lights fade into darkness. Barely two hours later, the sun rises.   The trip was provided by SALT, which is at Sandhornya until 6 September 2015. Njalla cabins sleep up to four and cost 125 a night for one person, plus 20 for each extra person. Event tickets from 15. A day package with transfers from Bod, guided tour, dinner and sauna costs 126pp. Book at salted.no. Norwegian Airlines (norwegian.com) flies to Oslo from Gatwick and Manchester from 70 return, and from Oslo to Bod from 145 return. Singles Bod to Sandhornya costs 19.50 ferry, 13 bus "

This redesigned strip of coastline has a new promenade, snack bars and a couple of boutique hotels.montemulinihotel.com DestinationLatvia may not be the first country that springs to mind when you're planning a family holiday, but a new trip from Baltic Holidays ticks all the right boxes: sandy beaches; fun activities, such as a barefoot woodland safari; warm dry summers; and reasonable prices. You even get to spend a night in a pod on the beach. From 488pp, including flights, accommodation, car hire and activities, balticholidays.com A collection of immersive safaris allows you to get much closer to the animals, including swimming with blue whales in Sri Lanka and floating among grizzlies on the salmon run in Alaska. But these once-in-a-lifetime experiences don't come cheap  From 1,450 for a week's ocean safari in South Africa to 40,975 for a nine-day Antarctica safari, naturalworldsafaris.com Strange but true: sunglasses don't float. Or at least they didn't, until one company injected theirs with a special formula to stop them sinking. They look a lot more stylish than goggles, too.From 135, dragonalliance.com  Still think hostels mean sweaty dorm rooms in dreary buildings? Think again: Hostelling International's network includes treehouses in Turkey, converted railway carriages in New Zealand, a converted jumbo jet in Sweden and a lighthouse in Canada.From 10 a night, blog.hihostels.com What works out cheaper overall, all-inclusive or B&B? According to a survey by the Post Office, B&B is your best bet (everywhere but Mallorca, weirdly), thanks to the extras people splash out on during so-called all-inclusive trips. For example, a B&B family holiday to the Algarve costs on average 342 less than the all-in equivalent. Details at media.postoffice.co.uk  Apparently we are a lot more cultured on holiday than at home. According to a survey by Opinion Matters, city-breakers cram more than a third of their annual ""culture intake""  galleries, museums, festivals, events, etc  into a single weekend away."

Below me was more than 100m of near-vertical ice. But, as I stood panting and sweating at the top, my gaze was drawn upwards to the dark, fortress-like building looming through the trees. This was the Vemork hydroelectric power station, scene of one of the most successful acts of sabotage of the second world war.</p> <p>I had just climbed Bakveien, an ice-route in the Rjukan valley, part of southern Norway's Telemark region. Tucked in between steep mountains, the small industrial town of Rjukan lies at one end of the narrow valley, while at the head is the power station. Running between them is a deep, thickly forested ravine, the sides of which are covered in fantastical ice-formations in winter, making it one of the best ice-climbing spots in Europe.&#xa0; But 70 years ago, the Nazis had other things in mind: this area was central to their plans to develop a nuclear bomb. A plant at Vemork was producing deuterium oxide <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> heavy water, essential for the atomic chain reaction <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> so Winston Churchill authorised a secret mission to destroy the supplies.</p> <p>The only access to the seven-storey factory on a shelf high above the ravine was a narrow suspension bridge guarded by a minefield.

Below me was more than 100m of near-vertical ice. But, as I stood panting and sweating at the top, my gaze was drawn upwards to the dark, fortress-like building looming through the trees. This was the Vemork hydroelectric power station, scene of one of the most successful acts of sabotage of the second world war. I had just climbed Bakveien, an ice-route in the Rjukan valley, part of southern Norway's Telemark region. Tucked in between steep mountains, the small industrial town of Rjukan lies at one end of the narrow valley, while at the head is the power station. Running between them is a deep, thickly forested ravine, the sides of which are covered in fantastical ice-formations in winter, making it one of the best ice-climbing spots in Europe. But 70 years ago, the Nazis had other things in mind: this area was central to their plans to develop a nuclear bomb. A plant at Vemork was producing deuterium oxide  heavy water, essential for the atomic chain reaction  so Winston Churchill authorised a secret mission to destroy the supplies. The only access to the seven-storey factory on a shelf high above the ravine was a narrow suspension bridge guarded by a minefield. On the night of 27 February 1943, nine Norwegian members of the Special Operations Executive (SOE) penetrated the defences by making an audacious climb up the frozen side of the ravine. Operation Gunnerside, as it was codenamed, was successful in destroying the heavy-water cylinders, and a version of the story was later told in the 1965 film The Heroes of Telemark. Oscar-winning director Danny Boyle has signed up to tell the story again in a 10-part TV mini-series called Telemark.

In winning the skate sprint  essentially running on skis around a cross country course of about 1.5km  at the Norwegian championships last month he served notice that he was to be taken seriously in Sochi. The 23-year-old, who grew up in the Scottish town of Huntly, moved to Norway in 2009 to train with a ski school there. He has since learned the language, earned a contract with a semi-professional team and is studying engineering  in Norwegian. Musgrave's victory had a similarly seismic effect on the national psyche  in reverse  to the ""one hell of a beating"" their football team gave Ron Greenwood's England in 1981. Since it was included in the inaugural Winter Olympics in Chamonix in 1924, the Norwegians have won almost 100 medals. Musgrave found himself on the front of the Norwegian papers and the subject of endless television interviews about his feat, which was all the more impressive given that his competitors were battling for selection for Sochi. ""It was quite good fun. All the Norwegian press were shocked that this British guy has beaten all their Olympic hopefuls. I thought it was all a bit of fun, poking fun at their sprint team, making the most of it."" Musgrave, whose sister Rosamund will also compete in Sochi, believes he should ""definitely"" make it through the heats and the quarter-finals to the semi-finals in Tuesday's sprint. ""Once you get to the semi-finals, it's the top 12 who reach that stage, then anything can happen there. It's a long, hard course,"" says Musgrave, who competed in the Vancouver Games when he was still a teenager and recorded a best finish of 51st in the 30km pursuit. ""Some people can just be too tired from the quarter-finals. There are falls and things like that. Once you reach the semi-finals, you have a good chance of qualifying to the final. Once you are in the final, anything can happen."" Musgrave, who started skiing when his family moved to Alaska when he was five, will also compete in longer races in Sochi, but feels the sprint is his best chance of success.

But <em>My Struggle</em> isn't TV, nor is it even fiction. His six-volume epic is nothing less than his entire life, in all its tedium and occasional ecstasy, committed to paper, at the rabid rate of 20 pages a day.</p> <p>The level of obsession around this literary <em>Gesamtkunstwerk</em> has been so intense that some Norwegian workplaces have reportedly instituted ""Knausgaard-free days"", when staff are forbidden to talk about the books.

Now, the books have been translated into 15 languages and the English-speaking world is impatiently awaiting the third instalment of Don Bartlett's translation, published later this month.</p> <p>Knausgaard was already a respected writer in Norway before he began the work that made him an international literary phenomenon. His first novel, 1998's <em>Out of the World</em> won the Norwegian Critics' prize for literature, the first debut ever to do so. His second, 2004's <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Time-Everything-Karl-Ove-Knausgaard/dp/098003308X"" title=""""><em>A Time For Everything</em></a> is a meditation on angels that earned him more critical acclaim and several prizes. <em>My Struggle</em>, though, came out of a personal crisis. He was 40 years old and had lost faith in fiction. He was attempting to write a novel about his father but every sentence he forced out ""was met with the thought, 'But you're just making this up. It has no value.'""</p> <p>So he began writing about his father as truthfully and directly as he could and didn't stop, not bothering to embellish or elide, or even to avoid cliches. Once he was done writing about his father he began writing about everything else. In 2009, he published the first volume of a work totalling more than 3,500 pages.</p> <p>""Concealing what is shameful to you,"" he's said, ""will never lead to anything of value."" And the most indelible moments tend to involve his own humiliation. In book two, <em>A Man in Love</em>, for example, he describes getting drunk, breaking a glass and slicing up his own face, when the woman he loves rejects him. Even more abject and embarrassing are book three's boyhood recollections, including an unhappy appraisal of his own penis, ""like a little cork.

He would go to bed at the same as his children, 8pm, and then begin writing at 4am the next morning. ""I had,"" he's admitted, ""no life outside of my family and my writing.""</p> <p>His headlong approach, devoid of artifice, makes for plenty of bad prose, but it also gives a reader the irresistible sensation of reading a life as it's lived <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> reality, in real time. Real life of course, is mostly boring and in book one, the longueurs are almost comic in their banality. A teenage mission to procure beer for a New Year's Eve party, for example, occupies about 70 pages in book one. Throughout, innumerable quotidian tasks are rendered as meticulously and exhaustively as autopsies. Here, for example, is the making of a cup of tea: ""After a while I picked up the teapot and poured. Dark brown, almost like wood, the tea rose inside the white cup. A few leaves swirled and floated up, the others lay like a black mat at the bottom. I added milk, three teaspoons of sugar, stirred, waited until the leaves had settled on the bottom, and drank. Mmm.""</p> <p>Yet, as the <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/media/the-new-yorker"" title=""""><em>New Yorker</em></a>'s book critic James Wood put it, ""even when I was bored, I was interested"".

And Knausgaard does indeed seem to have reached a ""writer's writer"" status, like that of Marcel Proust, to whom he is most often compared. (Knausgaard has said: ""I not only read <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/nov/14/proust-a-la-recherche-novel-big-world"" title=""""><em><c3><83><c6><92><c3><82><e2><82><ac> la recherche du temps perdu</em></a>, but virtually imbibed it."")</p> <p>This fandom on the part of other writers is an envious kind, not just because he's so good, but because he has a knack for defying every piece of received wisdom about how to write well. As he declared in one interview: ""The critical reading of the texts always resulted in parts being deleted. So that was what I did. My writing became more and more minimalist. In the end, I couldn't write at all. For seven or eight years, I hardly wrote. But then I had a revelation. What if I did the opposite?

Her victory wasnt a total surprise, though: She has two World Cup victories and looked the strongest throughout the day. She also had the fastest time in qualifying and then won both her quarterfinal and semifinal heats. Falla was up front for most of the final and her lead never looked threatened on the final sprint. The race for second was much closer, with Oestberg overtaking Fabjan just before the finish line. Randalls attempt at becoming the first American woman to win an Olympic cross-country skiing medal fell well short when she finished fourth of six skiers in a tough heat that featured both Bjoergen and German sprint specialist Denise Herrmann. Those two advanced, along with Gaia Vuerich of Italy, who had the second best time of the third-place finishers in the five heats. Randall, a two-time World Cup sprint champion, waited to see if her time would be good enough as well, but then gave a shrug to the camera when she found out it wasnt. Bjoergen was far back in her semifinal entering the final straight and then fell as she tried to move up the field. She still smiled when she crossed the line, waving one pole in the air. In the mens event Norwegian Petter Northugs miserable Olympics continued when he was eliminated in the semi-finals. Several other top contenders, including 2010 sprint champion Nikita Kriukov of Russia, were eliminated before the final. "

Oslo, the clear favourite, withdrew on cost grounds after the Norwegian government voted against providing the necessary guarantees. More than 50% of the population were against the hosting of the Games, and the minority partner in the ruling coalition voted four months ago against bidding. We feel sorry for sport in Norway and the athletes, said the IOC president, Thomas Bach. Its really a missed huge opportunity for sports and the people of Norway. He insisted the IOC had not been damaged by Oslo becoming the fourth city to pull out of the race. We havent even got a black eye. We should not forget we have two candidates who are offering two very interesting approaches, he said. Norways move provoked an unusually angry response from the IOC, which had offered $880m (550m) towards the hosting of the event. The director of sport Christophe Dubi said the decision had been based on half-truths and factual inaccuracies, and rounded on government officials for not turning up to key meetings. In a round of interviews to try to repair the damage on Thursday, Bach said the IOC would not reopen the bidding process. The two remaining bidders, neither of which are established winter sport nations, are likely to be targeted by human rights campaigners. Last week it emerged that the IOC had written an explicit anti-discrimination clause into the host city contract. Stockholm in Sweden, Krakow in Poland and Lviv in Ukraine had all withdrawn bids in recent months. Before that, potentially strong bids from St Moritz, Switzerland, and Munich, Germany, were dropped after being rejected by voters in referendums. The $51bn cost of hosting the Sochi Winter Olympics, the most expensive in history, has made governments and their citizens wary of hosting the Games. Bach has repeatedly stressed that the majority of Russias investment was in infrastructure projects and regeneration that was separate from the $2bn operational budget. But given the increased tendency to award major sporting events to nations keen to use them as the impetus for major infrastructure projects, it is increasingly hard to differentiate between the two budgets. The shortlist for the 2020 summer Games, which will be held in Tokyo, was only three-strong after Rome pulled out for economic reasons. Bach accepted that financial concerns had hindered its search for a host for the 2022 Games but said proposed changes to the bidding process, which would reduce costs and increase transparency, would help. We have to communicate, communicate, communicate about the two different budgets, said Bach, who was elected president last year. We have to see how we can reduce the costs of the management of the games and the cost of bidding for the Games. His Olympic Agenda 2020 proposals, which include ideas to reduce the cost of bidding for and hosting the Games, will be voted on in Monaco in December. The proposal is to change the philosophy of bidding, he told Reuters. In the past we have asked the cities in which way they would fulfil the conditions set. So in the future we would prefer to ask the cities how they see an Olympic Games best fitting into their long-term social, sports, ecological and economic development. Public sentiment in Norway, which has a proud winter sports tradition and is always well represented by travelling fans at the Winter Olympics, was clouded not only by the huge costs of the Sochi Games but newspaper reports outlining the IOCs demands. Beijing is now the favourite to win the vote next year and become the first city to host both the winter and summer Games. If it is chosen it would also mean that after Rio in 2016 three Olympics in a row  Pyeongchang in 2018, Tokyo in 2020 and potentially Beijing in 2022  being held in Asia."

In multiparty systems, the evidence is less clear and a potential relationship is likely to depend on the specifics of the party system and party competition in each country. In particular, most western European countries have witnessed the establishment and subsequent growth of new left and new right parties. Electoral support for new left parties does not come primarily from the lower socioeconomic groups that have been the main constituency of traditional social-democratic parties.

The characteristics and the geographical impact of the reform allows for a research design where we examine the trends in turnout and election outcomes before and after the reform, and how the trends depend on the type of municipality.

In particular, the trends in the vote share of the Labour party and the Progress party were significantly stronger in areas where turnout increased. Compared with the average municipality, Labour's vote share decreased by about 0.8 percentage points more in municipalities where turnout did not increase, compared to the most rural municipalities. The Progress party's vote share trend was negative, yet this trend was a lot more pronounced in urban municipalities where there were no positive effects of the reform on turnout.</p> <p>Similarly, our results for the Socialist Left party are also as expected. They deviated negatively from the municipal trend in those areas where the reform had the most impact on turnout. In particular, their vote share increased about 0.4 percentage points more in urban areas with no increase in turnout, compared with the most rural areas. When we use the reform-induced geographical variation in turnout to estimate the effect of turnout, we find that a one percentage point increase in turnout causes the vote share of Labour to rise by an estimated 0.9 percentage points.

The DMZ Academy, named after the highly militarised border zone between North and South Korea, is expected to take place in Pyongyang for two weeks August next year. If it is successful, organisers hope to eventually establish a permanent international art school. We hope to use the concept of art to challenge preconceptions both inside and outside North Korea, Morten Traavik, one of the artists behind the project, told the Guardian by phone from Norway. There have been a few international photography exhibitions in Pyongyang, but it is the first time that artists from all sides are meeting to exchange ideas and create new works. North Korean authorities tightly control interactions between ordinary citizens and international visitors, who are usually supervised by minders.  Traavik has been to North Korean 10 times and has worked with cultural authorities on four art projects within the country. He and fellow artist Henrik Placht are hoping to find around six creatives from outside the North to attend the academy, which will not only include visual arts but also video, photography, installation, illustration and graphic design, as well as the distinctly North Korean choreography of mass gymnastics at the Arirang games. Like other programmes he has led in the North, Traavik admits this one will be subject to strict limitations on what the artists can express in their works. Explicit criticism of the leadership is out of the question of course, but I have no problem at all with that, says Traavik. It is a question of respecting the cultural and political norms. There are counterproductive hangups in the western world that all valid interaction with North Korea should involve some kind of human rights lecturing  I dont believe in that. Critics have accused Traavik of working too closely with the authoritarian government in Pyongyang, which is accused of perpetrating grave rights abuses against its people. He rejects claims that he is naive or brainwashed and says he believes that engaging with North Korea is the only way to break through the myths created by the governments propaganda and the world media echo chamber. Obviously we will not bring artists like Pussy Riot, or Tracey Emin, or Banksy this time... that is too much too soon, says Traavik. What we will do is select artists who can bring in new ideas, but stop short of being deliberately controversial. We must remember that, like much of the rest of the world, North Korea has had no age of enlightenment when it comes to critical thought. The very notion of contemporary art as as a tool of controversy, it is as though it comes from another planet. North Koreas visual art scene is largely limited to the genre of socialist realism. The nations 1000 top artists are employed at the celebrated Mansudae Art Studio, which is dedicated to creating patriotic artworks both at home and abroad, and are sold for all-important foreign currency. However, Traavik argues that North Korean artists are perfectly capable of more than just reproduction across a variety of genres, especially performance art. On one level, North Korean society is so centered on the act of performing  in both literal and proverbial senses  that I half-jokingly call the whole country the worlds biggest and longest performance, he said. Though the creation of a permanent international art school is a long way off, some have already voiced their scepticism about the idea. There is an issue related to making sure that the quality of education is just as good as the one we have here in Norway, Cecilie Broch Knutsen, rector of Oslos School of Fine Arts, told Norways public broadcaster NRK, in comments translated by artnet news. It seems to me that it will be very difficult to achieve in North Korea."

Having started linking Bangkok, Oslo and New York last year, the airline will only be running three Gatwick-USA flights a week until its fleet of three 787 Dreamliners doubles.</p> <p>Norwegian Air Shuttle itself has grown from similarly small beginnings <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> Kjos claims to have become the boss by default: having left the air force he was working as a lawyer for friends at what was a small domestic airline, until he found himself the major shareholder when not enough other employees fancied investing in the business. Twenty years on, Norwegian has a short-haul fleet of 80 planes <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> and that new Gatwick base.</p> <p>Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's boss, dismisses the new operation as insignificant. But others have pinned significant hopes to Norwegian's success: Gatwick boss Stewart Wingate, pushing the claims of his airport for a second runway against Heathrow, described Norwegian's long-haul launch as a ""game-changing event"".</p> <p>But how would low-cost long haul work? Kjos said the bets have been changed by three things: more fuel-efficient planes, the internet and a shift in global economic power.</p> <p>The Boeing 787 gives a greater range and guzzles less fuel than previous comparable models; Kjos also financed the purchase of his planes at favourable rates due to export guarantees not available to rivals based in the US or EU countries where the aircraft are manufactured. The internet, he said, does away with marketing costs and circumvents the problems that made past ventures such as Freddie Laker's fail. ""He might have had a chance if the digital world had existed, but he had to rely on the travel agents, which strangled him. Now you Google and you find the cheap&#xa0;tickets.""</p> <p>Flying a short-haul low-cost operation is a prerequisite, he said. The lessons to be implemented in long-haul include intense aircraft utilisation: the schedule and routes, with hops to LA and Florida, mean his 787s will be in the air for 18 hours a day rather than the average of 12, with swift turnarounds wherever they land.</p> <p>He is relocating his bases to places with large catchment areas, Bangkok and American cities rather than Oslo <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> and hiring local crews at a fraction of Norwegian salaries.

The tall, craggy Norwegian Air Shuttle boss swooped into Gatwick last year as an upstart rival to easyJet and Ryanair  now already he has his sights trained on other targets, with plans to start flights to New York this July for as little as 389 return. Flying low cost across the Atlantic overturns accepted industry wisdom  similar BA flights are currently priced upwards of 800  but with Gatwick's owners desperate to break Heathrow's dominance of long-haul, Kjos, also at various times a lawyer and thriller writer, thinks he can make this seemingly unlikely plot work. The scale is tiny  so far. Having started linking Bangkok, Oslo and New York last year, the airline will only be running three Gatwick-USA flights a week until its fleet of three 787 Dreamliners doubles. Norwegian Air Shuttle itself has grown from similarly small beginnings  Kjos claims to have become the boss by default: having left the air force he was working as a lawyer for friends at what was a small domestic airline, until he found himself the major shareholder when not enough other employees fancied investing in the business. Twenty years on, Norwegian has a short-haul fleet of 80 planes  and that new Gatwick base. Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's boss, dismisses the new operation as insignificant. But others have pinned significant hopes to Norwegian's success: Gatwick boss Stewart Wingate, pushing the claims of his airport for a second runway against Heathrow, described Norwegian's long-haul launch as a ""game-changing event"". But how would low-cost long haul work? Kjos said the bets have been changed by three things: more fuel-efficient planes, the internet and a shift in global economic power. The Boeing 787 gives a greater range and guzzles less fuel than previous comparable models; Kjos also financed the purchase of his planes at favourable rates due to export guarantees not available to rivals based in the US or EU countries where the aircraft are manufactured. The internet, he said, does away with marketing costs and circumvents the problems that made past ventures such as Freddie Laker's fail. ""He might have had a chance if the digital world had existed, but he had to rely on the travel agents, which strangled him. Now you Google and you find the cheaptickets."" Flying a short-haul low-cost operation is a prerequisite, he said. The lessons to be implemented in long-haul include intense aircraft utilisation: the schedule and routes, with hops to LA and Florida, mean his 787s will be in the air for 18 hours a day rather than the average of 12, with swift turnarounds wherever they land. He is relocating his bases to places with large catchment areas, Bangkok and American cities rather than Oslo  and hiring local crews at a fraction of Norwegian salaries. Kjos insists the reasons are more strategic and operational than purely the wage bill  while he admits that there are ""lower social costs"" in Bangkok, he said they pay the same, low salaries to American and Thaicrew. Kjos has more than a touch of the O'Leary when discussing controversies around his airline, which has jettisoned Scandinavian terms of employment, set up bases abroad and now officially operates under an Irish licence, partly to benefit from open skies agreements with the US. In Norway, there have been complaints that it is no longer really a Norwegian airline. ""We don't give a shit about that. We go where the passengers go. Norway is just too small to survive."" The future, he said, will see not just millions of Europeans, let alone Norwegians, seeking out a holiday bargain, but Chinese, Indian and other customers with disposable income.

In Scandinavia, Norwegian's nascent long-haul service has been deluged with complaints. Almost half of its summer departures were delayed, while hundreds of passengers were left stranded over Christmas in New York after problems with the Dreamliner. Goodwill is in short supply for Norwegian in parts of the US, and pilots have threatened to strike. As one observer said, Kjos has found nifty, entrepreneurial ways to cut costs, but they may come back to bite him: on a small fleet, there is little slack when things go wrong. At Gatwick in the summer, with no alternative airline on hand to rebook US-bound passengers, could have unpleasant repercussions for the airline and the airport's credibility. Others have tried and failed to make the business work. Zoom Airlines, a Canadian operation linking Gatwick and North America, had a brief existence in the last decade. Air Asia X, the long-haul branch of Malaysia's successful budget airline, also couldn't make the sums work from London. Three years after launching direct flights from Kuala Lumpur to Stansted, later switching to Gatwick, the service was pulled in spring 2012. Air Asia's chief executive Tony Fernandes said that service could restart ""as soon as Airbus gives us a plane that makes sense"" economically.

Sir Howard Davies, the chair of the airports commission, told the Commons transport committee: ""Are we going to see low-cost long haul?

The choice laid out so far for airport expansion in the UK  the Heathrow hub or Gatwick alternative  to a large part rests on those kind of competing visions of the future.

As well as the twice-weekly service to LA, Norwegian will operate two flights a week to Fort Lauderdale, where the majority of the cabin crew will be based, while a London-New York service has its first flight on Thursday. The new operation from Norwegian Air Shuttle has attracted controversy, particularly in the United States, for taking advantage of differing international legislation to circumvent labour costs and buy aircraft on more favourable terms than competitors. Consumers will also struggle to find a seat at the advertised cheapest fares, on the relatively few long-haul services that Norwegian runs. Only seven of its 95 planes are capable of transatlantic flights. Norwegian will run a service pitched somewhere between the low-cost European model and traditional transatlantic carriers, with seat-back entertainment included but food and luggage incurring extra charges. The airlines chief executive, Bjrn Kos, said: At Norwegian, we believe that everyone should be able to afford to fly. In order to compete in the global airline industry you need to adapt to changes and keep a constant focus on cost. Norwegian has a low-cost model, meaning a lean administration, brand new and fuel-efficient aircraft and efficient operations. We fly direct routes with high passenger demand and choose centrally located airports such at Gatwick that share our mindset. Kos says costs have been driven down by the fuel efficiency of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner plane. The airline, which already operates similar services between Thailand, Scandinavia and the US, has come under fire in Norway and elsewhere for employing crew in Bangkok on Singaporean contracts. Unions have accused Norwegian of undermining labour conventions, with the ITF likening its pursuit of operating licences to the shipping practice of registering vessels under flags of convenience. Norwegian said it established its long-haul company in Dublin for its air traffic rights as an EU nation and to maintain export guarantees to finance its fleet orders, and that the airline fully complies with European safety standards. Pilots union Balpa said concerns remained, although a ruling in the US has prevented Norwegian from using pilots from Bangkok on the new Gatwick routes. Balpa said: The use of European pilots on this new route will reassure passengers who may otherwise have been concerned about an airline associated with a particular country by name which is in fact cherry-picking another country to oversee its safety standards and yet another to employ its pilots. For Gatwick, however, the Norwegian long-haul launch is a milestone in its battle for expansion. Its chief executive, Stewart Wingate, said: A low-cost carrier flying to the Big Apple for a small price shows how fast aviation is changing and highlights one of a series of future trends that will have a huge bearing on the UKs runways debate. The airport unveiled a new report by independent aviation consultant Chris Tarry, which set out how the latest generation of aircraft could affect London airport expansion, with a fuel economy, size and range that lowers the need for connecting passengers and opens up the development of low-cost long-haul services. Tarrys report says Gulf expansion would also lower the demand for connections in a London hub, but he believes that traffic will grow due to the strength of the capital as a destination in its own right. Wingate added: As this new report outlines, it is the airlines fleet plans and order books of today that hold the key to the expansion needs of tomorrow. New generation aircraft and other key trends will lead to a reduction in hub connecting traffic, an increase in point-to-point services and the continued growth of low-cost carriers, all of which are cornerstones of Gatwicks case for a second runway. He added: Heathrows plans are yesterdays solution to tomorrows problem and that only expansion of Gatwick can meet the challenges and demands of the future."

One of them, Norwegian Air Shuttle, plans to use cheaper US-based flight attendants rather than Norwegian ones for its new transatlantic flights.

""Norwegian could have based its long-haul company in any other European country and still used American and Asian crew, the way several other European airlines have been doing for years. The only exception is Norway and partly Denmark, who so far have opted to keep outdated special rules within this area.""</p> <p>Norwegian already employs a Thailand-based crew. Ryanair, Europe's most profitable airline, classifies its crew as working in Ireland because they fly on Ireland-registered aircraft, even though they live in several dozen Ryanair base cities around Europe. The practice lowers the carrier's labour costs.</p> <p>Ryanair director of communications, Michelle Lowe, says that the airline's flight attendants enjoy better rosters, better pay and much better promotional opportunities and job security than at legacy airlines, who are cutting jobs and pay.

He can decide the type of flights he wants to work on: he's opted for the short-haul fleet. He can decide when he wants to be on holidays. ""I'd love to stay until I'm 60,"" he says. But during John's career with BA, flight attendants' working conditions have worsened. ""Our basic salaries and allowances have stayed the same, but our hours have increased and there's less time between flights,"" he says. ""Every year it gets a bit tighter."" Low-cost carriers are setting the trend. One of them, Norwegian Air Shuttle, plans to use cheaper US-based flight attendants rather than Norwegian ones for its new transatlantic flights. ""We are concerned that Norwegian's announcement to hire US-based flight attendants to staff international flights undercuts labour laws, paying outsourced workers a fraction of what Norwegian flight attendants earn,"" the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA (AFA) said in a statement. Since its long-haul operations are based in Ireland, Norwegian can bypass its home country's strict labour laws. ""Ireland was not chosen because the country has specific rules and regulations that allow the use of American or Asian crew, like some politicians and unions have claimed,"" Norwegian spokesman Lasse Sandaker-Nielsen says. ""Norwegian could have based its long-haul company in any other European country and still used American and Asian crew, the way several other European airlines have been doing for years. The only exception is Norway and partly Denmark, who so far have opted to keep outdated special rules within this area."" Norwegian already employs a Thailand-based crew. Ryanair, Europe's most profitable airline, classifies its crew as working in Ireland because they fly on Ireland-registered aircraft, even though they live in several dozen Ryanair base cities around Europe. The practice lowers the carrier's labour costs. Ryanair director of communications, Michelle Lowe, says that the airline's flight attendants enjoy better rosters, better pay and much better promotional opportunities and job security than at legacy airlines, who are cutting jobs and pay. ""We have a waiting list of over 5,000 qualified pilots and cabin crew who wish to join Ryanair for our great conditions and secure jobs.""

Unless they have a limp handshake, of course ...</p>",2013,"When Brian Deane arrives to oversee morning training at Sarpsborg 08 he engages in a daily ritual which has become second nature. ""Before anything else happens everybody shakes hands,"" he says. ""Norwegians are very courteous and it shows respect  but you can also learn a lot about someone from their handshake, whether you'd want them alongside you in the trenches or if you might need to bin them!"" Deane is joking but the man who, back in 1992, scored the Premier League's first goal, takes his inaugural managerial job absolutely anything but lightly. ""I'm more passionate about managing than I ever was about playing,"" says the former Doncaster, Sheffield United, Leeds, Benfica, Middlesbrough, Leicester, West Ham, Sunderland and Perth Glory striker. ""Football management is all about solving puzzles and there's so much satisfaction when things go right, it's a fantastic feeling when you win, when you see a player improve. Coming to Sarpsborg is probably the best thing I've ever done."" What sets Deane apart is his desire to win in style. Newly promoted, Sarpsborg possess the smallest budget in the Tippeligaen, Norway's Premier League, and survival is the overriding aim but their manager aims to accomplish it courtesy of a gameplan based on clever, creative, considered passing and movement. ""We're in the results business so I don't want to be seen as someone whose side played fantastic football while always losing to the top teams but you get a lot more satisfaction if you follow your principles,"" says the 45-year-old, whose side stand second from bottom in the Tippeligaen. ""Avoiding relegation is vital but I'm proud of the football we're trying to play. I believe it's essential for clubs to have a brand, an identifiable philosophy. Everyone recognises Swansea's brand."" As Swansea headed for League Cup glory last season, Deane embarked on the biggest adventure of his life. ""Only he who wanders, finds new paths,"" is a Norwegian saying and by boarding an Oslo-bound flight last January a man capped three times by England did precisely that. An hour's drive from the Norwegian capital, Sarpsborg, twinned with Bethlehem and Berwick-upon-Tweed, is a small, charming, city not far from the Swedish border. Surrounded by vast tracts of woodland and situated close to the sea, its attractions prevent Deane from being consumed by his workaholic streak.

If the recommendation is accepted by the Finance Ministry, it will put a historic precedence on the world's largest investment fund. Repsol's activities could exterminate entire ethnic groups through epidemics, or force these extremely vulnerable indigenous peoples off their traditional land and into neighboring areas where they risk violent territorial conflicts with other indigenous groups. Norway must disinvest from Repsol, and we must do it immediately.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked to comment on TV2's broadcast, Repsol provided this statement to <em>The Guardian</em>: </p> <blockquote class=""quoted""> <p>The risk of contact in exploration activities can be effectively prevented with a proper Contingency Plan and the appropriate vaccination and training of the staff entering the block. These measures are being taken in block 39. . . The allegations of the existence of people in isolation in block 39 in the draft Report for Exclusion [sent by the Council to Repsol in 2009] are based on oral testimonies of some local individuals whose names are unavailable, and therefore cannot be contacted for ratification. No aerial pictures of abandoned camps or any man-made objects found in the area have been presented. We partnered with Smithsonian Institution, a first class US conservationist organization, to study the area. Smithsonian deployed a network of motion activated cameras in the area during several months, took over 15.000 pictures and found no human presence at all.</p> </blockquote> <p>However, Carmen Rosa Sandoval, from <a href=""http://www.earthrights.org/"">Earthrights International</a> in Peru, says Repsol's claims about its Contingency Plan are 'misleading' and 'more than irresponsible.'</p> <p>'It's impossible to effectively prevent disease transmission,' she says.

'It's difficult to understand why it should take longer than six months to make a decision on the basis of a recommendation by the Council,' the Council's chair, Ola Mestad, told TV2.  According to the broadcast, 'TV2 has confronted Repsol with the Norwegian research and their answer is that they have not found any isolated indigenous tribes in the area where they are exploring.' Zaman subsequently told The Guardian that the Council followed its recommendation three years ago with another report sent to the Ministry this year. He says:  The Council investigated Repsol for 18 months and after that submitted its report to the Ministry of Finance on 1 December 2010. In June 2013, the Council upheld its conclusions in another internal report to the Ministry. The dates I am mentioning are secret until the report is public, but we have them confirmed from sources.  TV2's broadcast follows claims made by Rainforest Foundation Norway's Anders Krogh, based on 'several anonymous sources', to The Guardian in September that the Council has recommended that the Ministry withdraw from Repsol. According to both Krogh and now Repsol itself, the Council's concern centers on a concession called Lot 39, a 745,141-hectare area between the Napo and Tigre rivers in northern Peru where the Ministry of Energy estimates 'probable' oil reserves to be greater than any other concession in the country. However, huge swathes of Lot 39 overlap a proposed reserve for indigenous people living in what Peruvian law calls 'voluntary isolation' (IPVI) and who could be decimated by contact with oil workers or other outsiders. The reserve was proposed 10 years ago by regional indigenous organization ORAI but has never been created, and in June this year Repsol was given permission by the Ministry of Energy to drill exploratory wells and conduct 3D seismic tests across 680 sq. kms. Says RFN's director Dag Hareide: For the first time ever, a company could be blacklisted by a governmental investment fund for operating on the territory of uncontacted indigenous peoples. If the recommendation is accepted by the Finance Ministry, it will put a historic precedence on the world's largest investment fund. Repsol's activities could exterminate entire ethnic groups through epidemics, or force these extremely vulnerable indigenous peoples off their traditional land and into neighboring areas where they risk violent territorial conflicts with other indigenous groups. Norway must disinvest from Repsol, and we must do it immediately. Asked to comment on TV2's broadcast, Repsol provided this statement to The Guardian:  The risk of contact in exploration activities can be effectively prevented with a proper Contingency Plan and the appropriate vaccination and training of the staff entering the block. These measures are being taken in block 39. . . The allegations of the existence of people in isolation in block 39 in the draft Report for Exclusion [sent by the Council to Repsol in 2009] are based on oral testimonies of some local individuals whose names are unavailable, and therefore cannot be contacted for ratification. No aerial pictures of abandoned camps or any man-made objects found in the area have been presented. We partnered with Smithsonian Institution, a first class US conservationist organization, to study the area. Smithsonian deployed a network of motion activated cameras in the area during several months, took over 15.000 pictures and found no human presence at all. However, Carmen Rosa Sandoval, from Earthrights International in Peru, says Repsol's claims about its Contingency Plan are 'misleading' and 'more than irresponsible.' 'It's impossible to effectively prevent disease transmission,' she says. 'Not every virus, bacteria or parasite can be avoided by vaccinations, nor are they only introduced by people  but by clothes, belongings, equipment and food too.' Moreover, it is widely accepted that IPVI exist in the Napo-Tigre region and Repsol's apparent doubt is contradicted by reports by regional indigenous organization ORPIO  the successor to ORAI  and national indigenous organization AIDESEP, which include testimonies from local people about sightings and physical proof such as gardens, meat remains, shelters, paths, footprints and crossed spears.  The GPFG is considered by some to be the world's largest sovereign wealth fund and it was recently reported to have passed 5,000 billion Norwegian kroner, or approximately US$818 billion. It prides itself on its ethical guidelines and responsible investment, particularly its 'exclusion mechanism', which blacklists companies which commit, among other things, 'severe environmental damage' and 'serious or systematic human rights violations.' To date, 60 companies are currently excluded from the GPFG, including Lockheed Martin Corp, Boeing Co, British American Tobacco Plc, Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Rio Tinto Ltd and Vedanta Resources Plc.  Norway's Ministry of Finance declined to comment."

This German side might not be quite as good as previous incarnations, and the rest are getting closer, but they're still deserving winners. Otherwise, that's us - thanks for your company.  5.05pm BST Interesting lift - almost like a golf swing. There follows ticker-tape, to make sure no one can see properly.  5.03pm BST The players bounce as we wait for Angerer, who'll lift the trophy. I'm fairly sure she won't drop it.  5.03pm BST And up go Germany, led by Silvia Neid. This is her eighth European Championship win as player, assistant coach and coach.  5.01pm BST Norway ascend the stairs and accept their medals from Michel Platini, who is swept, tanned and rotund. There is a man whose job it is to pick them up and pass them to him.  4.58pm BST I'd take a hug from Silvia Neid.  4.56pm BST The Germans are prancing around. There is a laudable lack of indulgent crying from either side.  4.55pm BST There can't have been many better goalkeeping displays than that of Nadine Angerer. Two penalty saves, absurd - but even aside from that (not remotely aside from that), she was confident, composed, and most significantly of all, decisive.  4.53pm BST That is just thoroughly ridiculous.  4.52pm BST 90+4 min Germany keep the ball well, but Norway are chasing the game like a team who don't know how to chase games - they're just not playing with the urgency you need. The German players on the touchline are readying their celebrations...  4.51pm BST 90+2 min Since going behind, Norway haven't quite managed to muster momentum, Germany doing well to occupy their defenders with serious attacks not just aimed at wasting time.  4.49pm BST 90+1 min Still Norway play their football, but are now at the point where it makes more sense to stick as many players as possible into the box.  4.48pm BST 90 min There shall be four additional minutes.  4.48pm BST 89 min Kaurin wriggles past a challenge on the right and finds Hansen, who's been quiet this half. She jiggles some space, again waving her right foot over the ball, then crosses low, only to see it blocked behind for a corner that comes to nothing.  4.46pm BST 87 min Brilliant defending from Krahn, levering Hergerberg away from the ball after Mjelde arced over a cross from the right. Germany then do well to smuggle the ball downfield, Mittag larruping a shot over the bar from 20 yards.  4.44pm BST 86 min After threatening an equaliser when Thorsnes came on, Norway have struggled to create much in the last few minutes, Germany a little less excited in possession. They actually look the likelier scorers now.  4.43pm BST 84 min Final change for Norway, Kaurin replacing Christensen.   4.42pm BST 82 min That so almost morphed into that. Germany released Maier down the right, and she cut back a cross, Akerhaugen miscalculating how close she needed to be to Kessler. But measuring a finish into the far corner, her connection was slightly awry, the ball skipping into the base of the far post and away. Updated at 4.43pm BST  4.40pm BST 81 min Germany looked very nervous when hanging on against Sweden in the semi-final - and today, even Silvia Neid is pacing on the touchline with brooding intensity.  4.38pm BST 78 min Considering the appalling circumstances they've inflicted upon themselves, Norway have shown exceptional composure. It would be very easy, and justifiable, for them to quit existing, but there's been no panic, and they're still playing sensible, considered stuff, getting the ball forward quickly, but passing it inteligently once it gets there.  4.35pm BST 78 min There are only 12 minutes remaining. For shame.  4.35pm BST 77 min ""Re: your question about missing two penalties in a final,"" says Willem Cleven. ""Not a final, but a European Cup semi: Holland v Italy, 2000. We missed two penalties during the game before shanking another three during the resulting shootout. De Boer missed two, and Stam famously blasted one into the rafters. Terrible stuff."" And yet, so very, beautifully Dutch. Winning is beneath them.  4.34pm BST 75 min Change apiece. Stensland off, Isaksen off for Norway, Laudehr off, Schmidt off for Germany - very slowly.  4.32pm BST 72 min Dearie, dearie Norway. This is brilliant route-one football, a perfect long ball from Ronning finding Thorsnes between back-four and keeper. With Angerer charging towards her like billy-o, she arrives first and chucks a foot at it post-bounce - it's a goal! No it's not! Somehow, despite every appearance to the contrary, the ball skips wide of the right-hand post. Again, that's great keeping - had Angerer been any slower, Thorsnes would've had time to pick her spot. Like taking a penalty. Updated at 4.33pm BST  4.29pm BST 71 min A moment of calm.  4.28pm BST 69 min Marozsan invents some space, left of centre and 25 yards from goal. Immediately, she looks up and shoots, catching it beautifully with her laces, and the ball is not far wide - taken there only by an inadvertent deflection.  4.26pm BST 68 min Change for Norway, Thorsnes replacing Gulbrandsen. She looks a little peaky, it's fair to say.  4.25pm BST 67 min What a half this has been so far. When did a team last miss two penalties in a final?  4.24pm BST 65 min Norway think they've scored! They've not scored! They turn the German left flank - they've been threatening down that side all game - and Mjelde skips clear, crossing low. The ball is turned in almost from under the bar - but Hergerberg had pulled offside, Sian Massey noticing and flagging immediately. Basically, England are champions. Updated at 4.25pm BST  4.21pm BST First things first. Norway broke down their right, and Hansen attacked the space between Cramer and Marozsan, inhaling deeply and bursting between them on the corner of the box. Between the two of them, they sent her sprawling, and this time Gulbrandsen stepped up. Again, the shot was firm and central, a little higher this time, and again, Angerer moved to her left, this time thrusting up an arm to thump the ball away. What a thoroughly remarkable keeper she is. Updated at 4.57pm BST  4.18pm BST ....  4.18pm BST ....  4.18pm BST 57 min Off the line! Germany win a corner on the right, swung out to the middle of the box. For reasons known best to themselves, no one in the Norwegian defence felt that marking Da Mbabi was an activity worth of their pursuit, and she stepped back and headed firmly towards goal, Stensland deflecting it over the bar. And the second corner was hit almost identically, Da Mbabi again making it her business to pick up the ball first, this time shooting, only for Akerhaugen to deflect it over the top.   4.14pm BST 54 min Here's an MBM rarity - a real, live person, at the game. Here's Benj Gerdes: ""My Swedish wife and I are at the match. It appears a lot of Swedes have bought Norwegian flags and jerseys in the past four days as I thought I was sitting in the middle of a bunch of Norwegian fans until the Swedish team was brought out at half-time to do a thank you lap, prompting the strange spectacle of a bunch of Swedes wanting to cheer for their team but having nothing but big Norwegian flags to wave..."" It was a little odd, that lap of honour, all a bit John Terry. You want to run round waving at the crowd in the final, win it.   4.11pm BST 52 min Norway need to be careful here, because Germany are on it. Again, they find space down the left, Laudehr the runner this time - but she's strayed marginally offside.  4.09pm BST What a goal this is, and what a change that was. Germany break down the left, three sharp passes finding Marozsan on the touchline and allowing Laudehr to send Da Mbabi galloping away, the various defenders chugging along behind with no hope of stopping her. Looking up, she sees someone in the middle, squaring when she might have shot, and Mittag allows the ball across her body and across the inside of her foot, sending it spinning high past Hjelmseth. Updated at 5.00pm BST  4.07pm BST ...  4.07pm BST 47 min Norway keep up the pressure, forcing a corner, which Laudehr heads behind at the near post with her eyes closed. But it was a useful intervention, because there was a collection of her pals waiting to head home. The following corner came to nothing.  4.05pm BST 47 min Hansen finds Dekkerhus with a short pass and scurries off into the box, the clipped return finding her and sitting up. She slams a shot goalwards, but can't quite keep it down.  4.03pm BST 46 min And off we pootle.  4.03pm BST German substitution: Mittag replaces Lotzen.  4.00pm BST Yes, hard drinking, good po-lice but with a liberal interpretation of the legalities of procedure.  3.53pm BST Not a bad half of football that, though Germany need to locate a little more gumption. When they force the play, they look likely to score - the Norway defence is really struggling with the movement of Marozsan and Da Mbabi. But Norway are equally dangerous when they can find space around the box, and more surprisingly, are holding their own in midfield. The second half ought to be better and oughtn't to be goalless.  3.49pm BST ...  3.49pm BST 45+1 min Lovely from Germany, Marozsan making a smart run in behind the Norway defence, and spinning to receive a pass on the left of the box. She immediately lays back for the onrushing Da Mbabi, who drills an immediate shot with her laces, but it's straight at Hjelmseth.  3.46pm BST 45 min There shall be a single, sole, solitary additional minute.  3.46pm BST 44 min A long, diagonal pass finds Hansen in the inside-right position, and she feints inside and out to fashion a shooting opportunity. But then she callously ruins literally everything by dragging a shot wide of the near post. Updated at 3.46pm BST  3.44pm BST 42 min Germany have upped their work-rate in the last few minutes, and win the ball back high up the pitch. Kessler sees a bit of space ahead of her, so advances, before welting a shot well over the bar from outside the box.  3.41pm BST 40 min Silvia Neid, the Germany coach, is becoming angry - she's on the touchline glowering for quite some time now. Her players are getting told about themselves at half-time, you'd expect. Updated at 3.42pm BST  3.40pm BST 38 min Marozsan, who's been quiet, gallops away down the right and espies Da Mbabi, loitering in the box. She crosses low, but Da Mbabi is crowded out - Germany coiuld do with sending more players in the box.  3.37pm BST 35 min What a curious half this has been so far, superiority switching almost every five minutes. It's Norway who're in charge at the moment, so by the time I've finished typing, it'll probably be Germany back on top.  3.36pm BST 32 min Despite the miss, Norway are uncowed, and almost immediately supply the best passage of play so far. Hegerberg takes possession outside the box, and cleverly waves her foot over the ball to buy herself some time, waiting for Stensland to accelerate into the box before finding her with a perfect slide-rule pass. She zips past Basrtusiak, taking her through on goal, but again, Angerer is alert, dashing out to smother at her feet. Handy behaviour all round.  3.32pm BST And what a save! Ronning's kick is hammered down the middle, and she begins moving to her left, then flings up a knee and prangs it away. That's a brilliant piece of improvisation.  3.30pm BST After a free-kick isn't properly clearedm Dekkerhus barges into the box on the right, and Da Mbabi comes into tackle. There's a minor fusion of ankles, then a major jumping onto the grass a stride later, and the ref points to the spot. There is anger - lots of it. Updated at 3.50pm BST  3.29pm BST ....  3.28pm BST 27 min We've seen very little of Solveig Gulbrandsen so far - Norway will be hoping to address this - and she's fouled by Kessler. The free-kick comes to nothing.  3.27pm BST 26 min Minor heat experienced by Nadine Angerer, after the ref wrongly awards Norway a corner. For this she is allocated a ticking-off, then comes to punch the corner, ends up on the ground, and wins a free-kick. All's well that ends well.  3.26pm BST 24 min It's been a good few minutes for Germany, who are controlling the midfield now, playing from the back. Norway are trying to get the ball into the German half more quickly, and then dealing with it from there.  3.23pm BST 21 min Da Mbabi could score! Da Mbabi doesn't score! But this is a really good effort, peeling away towards the near post and reaching Laudehr's corner first, introducing brow to ball and heading only just wide.  3.22pm BST 20 min Da Mbabi should score! Da Mbabi doesn't score. A long, raking ball finds Kessler, pulling away from her marker and inside the box on the left. With no one remotely concerned, she knocked down superbly for the advancing Da Mbabi, who couldn't quite get her knee over the ball, and skelped over the top.  3.19pm BST 17 min Caroline Hansen is finding her way into the game now, diddling her man and putting the ball into space, then nutmegging Krahn. She couldn't convert her skill into opportunity, but Germany will be concerned at the space she found.  3.18pm BST 16 min ""Afternoon Daniel,"" says Simon McMahon. ""It's a wonder that the BBC don't have John Inverdale and Colin Murray on commentary."" I'm hoping for a feature at half-time.  3.16pm BST 14 min Another good situation for Norway, Hansen sending Mjelde away down the right. Shooting early and low, from just outside the box, Angerer got down to save easily enough, then managed to spill it for no reason, claiming at the second attempt.  3.14pm BST 11 min Norway's first attack of note, Hegland hanging up a cross towards the back post, Hansen losing Krahn who found herself stranded underneath it. Her forehead could only send the ball over the top, but Norway will feel a little better now. Updated at 3.14pm BST  3.11pm BST 9 min Suddenly Germany spring, Lotzen finding some space just outside the box, right of centre, and wiping her foot across a shot aimed at the far post. But she doesn't quite hit it as planned, and the ball goes wide. Then, Goessling plays a lovely ball between full-back and centre-back that almost sets Lotzen free down the right, but it's a little too strong. Great idea, though.  3.09pm BST 8 min The game's not really settled down yet, neither side's passing hitting the mark. Germany's midfielders are getting a little closer to one another and pressuring the ball, while Norway are dropping deeper when not in possession.  3.07pm BST 6 min There is very little on the planet worse than that ""Let's go Whoever, let's go"" chant.  3.07pm BST 5 min After all those smiles, Norway have begun nervously.  3.05pm BST 4 min Da Mbabi gets her first chance of the game, darting in behind the Norwegian defence and running onto Laudehr's pass, meeting it on the right of the box. But she doesn't quite get hold of her shot, which bobbles wide of the far post. Updated at 3.06pm BST  3.04pm BST 1 min Germany hit the bar! They win a free-kick on the right-hand side, plenty far from goal, but when it's swung across, the defenders all do nothing whatsoever, leaving Krahn alone in the box. She does well to loop a header towards the top-right corner, and Hjelmseth is slow to react, folding herself underneath it, not getting to it, and relieved to see it bounce against the face of the bar. Updated at 3.04pm BST  3.01pm BST 1 min Germany get us underway. For those watching in black and white, Norway are in the red shirts.  3.00pm BST Question: why do sportsfolk always do that angled handshake? And is it at all possible to employ one and be an acceptable, moral person? Updated at 3.01pm BST  2.58pm BST This Norway team remind me a little of Zambia's Cup of Nations winners - they're actually enjoying themselves. Who ever heard of such a thing? Disgraceful.  Updated at 2.58pm BST  2.54pm BST The players are in the tunnel. Some staring and stretching.  2.53pm BST Interesting. Even Pellerud reckons Norway's women have done so well historically because of the relatively early emancipation of women in the country. In England, meanwhile, the FA decided that ""the game of football is quite unsuitable for females and ought notto be encouraged.""   2.49pm BST Germany have scored five goals in the competition, three of those against Iceland - but then they've only conceded one. Norway have managed seven, letting in three. Updated at 2.49pm BST  2.40pm BST But back to the aforementioned ball-kicking (my apologies). A pair of fascinating semi-finals suggested that Norway have a really good chance of winning this game. Germany were far from convincing in beating Sweden, only avoiding extra-time by virtue of a narrow offside, a couple of convenient bounces of the ball and some poor finishing. Norway, on the other hand, did have to play an additional half-hour, after a late Denmark equaliser pegged them back, but their overall display was convincing and fearless.  2.27pm BST Preamble They say that familiarity breeds familiarity, and these two teams are familiar with one another, so accordingly, familiarity is present. They last met just three weeks ago, in the group stages of this competition, a game for which Norway, already through to the quarter-finals, made six changes to their starting XI - and still won. Incredibly, the defeat was Germany's first in the competition for 20 years - incredibly, they've won the last five - and are hot favourites to add a sixth this afternoon. Norway, on the other hand, are just chuffed to be there - even their coach, Even Pellerud, admitted that he didn't expect the team to do so well. But, of course, this could just be a version of the MIND GAMES that are so inconceivably mindy and gamish. Mind games. Mind games. Mind games.

The fixture has been described as the most important in the national team's history and, as such, essential viewing for those across Iceland's capital city, surrounding towns, villages and outposts. For 90 minutes, all that will matter to a country renowned for fishing and volcanoes will be the action from Oslo.</p> <p>Should Iceland win they will definitely retain second place in Group E and subsequently qualify for the World Cup play-offs. A draw or defeat would also be fine should third-place Slovenia fail to better their result against leaders Switzerland in Berne. Switzerland have little to play for given they have already secured their place for next summer's finals in Brazil, but neither do Norway who, stranded in fourth place, just have pride at stake. Little wonder, then, that there is confidence within Iceland's ranks that they can get the job done and put themselves within a two-legged tie of reaching a major tournament for a first ever time.</p> <p>""There is a lot of excitement around this match, everyone in Iceland will be watching,"" said Vidir Sigurdsson, sports editor of Morgunbladid, one of country's largest daily newspapers. ""This is the most important game we have played in for many years <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> getting to the play-offs would represent a big step for us and one that most people here, including myself, did not see coming so soon.""</p> <p>Indeed, this campaign was simply meant to be a further learning experience for Iceland. Under the former manager Olafur Johannesson, a younger, more dynamic squad had been put together for the Euro 2012 qualifiers. Little was expected from them and little was delivered, with Iceland picking up just four points from a group containing Denmark, Portugal and, again, Norway. But the principal aim was to give the likes of Johann Gudmundsson, Kolbeinn Sigthorsson, Alfred Finnbogason, Birkir Bjarnason and the Premier League duo of Gylfi Sigurdsson and Aron Gunnarsson experience of playing competitive international games together, with the expectation that they would collectively peak during qualifying for Euro 2016.

The fixture has been described as the most important in the national team's history and, as such, essential viewing for those across Iceland's capital city, surrounding towns, villages and outposts. For 90 minutes, all that will matter to a country renowned for fishing and volcanoes will be the action from Oslo. Should Iceland win they will definitely retain second place in Group E and subsequently qualify for the World Cup play-offs. A draw or defeat would also be fine should third-place Slovenia fail to better their result against leaders Switzerland in Berne. Switzerland have little to play for given they have already secured their place for next summer's finals in Brazil, but neither do Norway who, stranded in fourth place, just have pride at stake. Little wonder, then, that there is confidence within Iceland's ranks that they can get the job done and put themselves within a two-legged tie of reaching a major tournament for a first ever time. ""There is a lot of excitement around this match, everyone in Iceland will be watching,"" said Vidir Sigurdsson, sports editor of Morgunbladid, one of country's largest daily newspapers. ""This is the most important game we have played in for many years  getting to the play-offs would represent a big step for us and one that most people here, including myself, did not see coming so soon."" Indeed, this campaign was simply meant to be a further learning experience for Iceland. Under the former manager Olafur Johannesson, a younger, more dynamic squad had been put together for the Euro 2012 qualifiers. Little was expected from them and little was delivered, with Iceland picking up just four points from a group containing Denmark, Portugal and, again, Norway. But the principal aim was to give the likes of Johann Gudmundsson, Kolbeinn Sigthorsson, Alfred Finnbogason, Birkir Bjarnason and the Premier League duo of Gylfi Sigurdsson and Aron Gunnarsson experience of playing competitive international games together, with the expectation that they would collectively peak during qualifying for Euro 2016. Instead, under the charge of former Sweden coach Lars Lagerback, they have made their mark two years in advance. ""We are young and we do not scare easily,"" said Cardiff City's Gunnarsson in a manner befitting the captain of a side that has blown apart expectations. ""We have already put pressure on ourselves and now we just have to handle it. The Norwegians will not give us anything, like we wouldn't give them anything.

Go before the ""Balamory effect"" kicks in and you'll have the white-sand beaches, wild Atlantic seascapes and impossibly starry skies all to yourself. What to doAs the endearingly honest visitor website points out, there are no ""attractions"" (visitcoll.co.uk). It's about the simple things: wildlife spotting, shore walks and star gazing. Coll has just been designated Scotland's first Dark Sky island with plans to launch regular astronomy events in the new year (darkskies.visitcoll.co.uk). Where to stayThe Coll Hotel is the island's only hotel and has just six simple, comfy rooms, views of the bay, a cosy bar and memorable breakfasts (collhotel.com). A good budget alternative is the shiny new Coll Bunkhouse, with spotless dorms (collbunkhouse.com). Where to eatThe Gannet Restaurant at the Coll Hotel (see previous entry) is your best bet for seafood and a menu which makes the most of island produce. Insider tip""My favourite beach is Toraston,"" saysJulie Oliphant, owner of the Coll Hotel. ""It's got lots of character, and it'seasily accessible and safe for kids. You often see basking sharks and assoon as the seals hear voices they'll swim over to take a look."" Live it up in London Assuming there's still life left in the credit card following the annual Christmas shopping splurge, book yourself into the Cumberland Hotel in London's West End for a January sales break. Guests booking atwo-night stay at the hotel before 31 March are being offered a 50 Selfridgesvoucher. Rooms start at 219per night and Oxford Street is on yourdoorstep (guoman.com/shopping).

Under its current ""red-green"" government, Norway has in fact steered clear of the economic and social debacle that has mired the EU project since 2008. Growth rates have been stable over the past five years and unemployment is lower in Norway than in any of the countries in the European Union. This is not to say that there are not challenges ahead for Norway's economy. For example, there is still inequality and poverty amid plenty, and immigrants and minority communities suffer its consequences disproportionally. However, there is no conceivable way in which the neoliberal agenda touted by the Conservatives can address such challenges. On the contrary  the eager pursuit of such an agenda in the current context shows what the objective for the Conservatives really is, namely, a project geared towards redistributing wealth in favour of society's elites. In doing so, this project will undermine what has been an enduring and valuable feature of Norwegian society  and a key reason why the country topped the UNDP's human development index in 2013  which is a social infrastructure that ensures the availability of crucial public goods and underpins the country's relative egalitarian social structure. In other words, the 2013 elections have thrown up a marriage of neoliberal conservatism and rightwing populism that threatens to entrench that which we need to rid ourselves of and erode that which we should struggle to keep."

""That way the fund lasts for ever,"" he said in a speech at Harvard University. ""The problem in Europe with the deficits and the debt crisis is that many European countries have spent money they don't have. The problem in Norway is that we don't spend money we do have.

Stoltenberg, a Labour party member who served two consecutive four-year terms as prime minister, said his administration restricted itself to spending the investment gains made by the fund.

""They have on the bench, one of the most accomplished passers in his age group but went with Chalobah and Henderson. I can accept Henderson being selected automatically because of his experience and obviously because he's actuallya pretty good player. But it's so easy to see that England need someone who can use the ball positively and can retain it under pressure. Josh McEachran reminded me of a young Cesc Fabregas when I first saw him and confirmed this for me ina stellar season at Boro. He plays well under pressure and despite his slight frame can go past people and open up new angles. If he comes on, he'll be farmed out wide because he is skillful. It's such a waste and anyone with any kind of basic football knowledge can see this. </p> <p>England must bring in Hoddle to coach the young kids. He always seemed to trust ""ball players"" and still talks passionately about this aspect of the game. England won the U17 Championship not so long back and McEachran stood out at that tournament as a passer. I don't see him blossoming into a top player because his club won't trust him and he certainly won't be given a chance to make his case at this tournament. A complete waste. I have watched English youth football closely for the past five years and the idea that English youth players are not great at passing the ball is a myth. It's just that the ones who can simply aren't trusted by the coaches who don't see their value. Like Pierce.

And that means they are out of the tournament. They have been a boring presence in it and their sole remaining ambition is to cast a further downer on the hosts' party by beating Israel in their last group game. England need to alter their approach to such tournaments to ensure they have more of their top young players available but smarter tactics are in order too and that probably means a change of manager. Hats off to Norway: we can expect to see a lot more of these players in the coming years. Updated at 6.54pm BST  6.48pm BST Chalobah booked for a foul as Norway pressurised England into a mistake at the back. There will be four more minutes for England to endure.  6.47pm BST Rose launches a freekick into the box from deep. Haskjold claims it again with ease.  6.44pm BST The masterplan almost works, as Caulker nods down a hefty punt and Wickham lets fly. A fine block by Strandberg diverts the ball wide for a corner.  6.43pm BST Ibrahim fires one low and wide from 20 yards.  6.42pm BST England substitution: Dawson off, Wisdom on. Caulker is shifted to centreforward, suggesting England are going to try an aerial bombardment.  6.41pm BST Chance for England! IT came from a set-piece, of course. Shelvey clipped a freekick in from the left, Henderson sent a glancing header narrowly wide from eight yards.  6.40pm BST Norway substitution: Rogne off, on comes Nordtveit, who played for the senior team against Albania last night.  6.39pm BST Henderson booked for diving. England can't even lose with dignity.  6.38pm BST A token shot by Wickham is easily saved by Haskjold. Norway are looking comfortable.  6.37pm BST England slip a quick freekick into the path of Henderson, whose cross from the right is put behind for a corner. Wickham meets the delivery but Norway clear.  6.36pm BST Speaking of pity, here Oleksander Knudsen via email: ""Watching the game in Norway as a Norwegian i should be quite pleased. But as most Norwegians I love English football. And the level of this u-21 team from England makes me sad. The players are good enough. The tactics aren`t. And that's the problem with your football. Without the head, the body won`t work. Coaches in England are few and not well educated.""  6.34pm BST Norway appeal for a penalty after Nielsen is hauled to the ground in the English box but the ref, perhaps out of pity, allows play to continue.  6.33pm BST Play resumes with a corner kick for England, which Hakjold claims with authority.  6.31pm BST As England knock the ball around with purpose but little penetration, Rogne goes down with cramp. There will be a break in play, during which England's challenge is come up with a plan to offset 30 years of footballing ignorance. Updated at 6.32pm BST  6.27pm BST Shelvey's first contribution is a good one, as he wins possession in midfield and luanches a rapid England counter-attack. Ince eventually threads the ball through to Zaha, who attempted to curl a shot into the far corner from 15 yards but failed to beat the defender.  6.25pm BST Norway substitution: Eikrem off, Ibrahim on.  6.24pm BST Norway come close to making it four, as Pedersen leaps to meet an in-swinging freekick from deep. His header glides wide.  6.24pm BST Substitutions: Redmond off, Shelvey on, hoping, no doubt, for a much-improved performance to the one he produced on Wednesday. ""I'm still amazed that anybody in the halls of footballing power thinks Pearce is a top manager,"" wibbles Andy Bradshaw. ""I mean it's as if all his past glories as footballer out weigh all his more recent, bigger, failures as a manager.""  6.21pm BST Zaha, now operating on the right as Ince and Wickham occupy the centre, misguides a cross towards the aforementioned duo.  6.18pm BST England have increased the tempo following the goal, seemingly in the belief that they can get back into this game. They are fooling themselves. Meanwhile, Moses Muchapirei has channeled his immense frustration with this display into a mighty long email. Put your slippers on, sit back and read: ""Watching this England performance is depressing, even for a non-England fan,"" weeps Moses Muchapirei. ""They have on the bench, one of the most accomplished passers in his age group but went with Chalobah and Henderson. I can accept Henderson being selected automatically because of his experience and obviously because he's actuallya pretty good player. But it's so easy to see that England need someone who can use the ball positively and can retain it under pressure. Josh McEachran reminded me of a young Cesc Fabregas when I first saw him and confirmed this for me ina stellar season at Boro. He plays well under pressure and despite his slight frame can go past people and open up new angles. If he comes on, he'll be farmed out wide because he is skillful. It's such a waste and anyone with any kind of basic football knowledge can see this.  England must bring in Hoddle to coach the young kids. He always seemed to trust ""ball players"" and still talks passionately about this aspect of the game. England won the U17 Championship not so long back and McEachran stood out at that tournament as a passer. I don't see him blossoming into a top player because his club won't trust him and he certainly won't be given a chance to make his case at this tournament. A complete waste. I have watched English youth football closely for the past five years and the idea that English youth players are not great at passing the ball is a myth. It's just that the ones who can simply aren't trusted by the coaches who don't see their value. Like Pierce. It's like rejecting gold for iron because it's not 'ard enough you see."" Updated at 6.20pm BST  6.14pm BST A perfect penalty by Dawson, who guided it low and hard into the corner beyond the keeper. The fightback begins!  6.13pm BST For a handball by Semb Berge as he attempted to clear a corner.  6.13pm BST ""Pearce is right to complain about lack of players at this tournament, but there should have been more questions asked of him when he took a team with Welbeck, Sturridge, Jones, Smalling, Cleverley, Walker and others to the last tournament and couldn't get out of the group stages and they knocked out France in the play-offs so they're nifty enough. Pearce has made five changes to the side that were royally outplayed by Italy on Wednesday, with the inclusions of Wilfried Zaha, Tom Ince and Nathaniel Chalobah all likely to add much-needed flair while Smith and Rose should strengthen the full-back areas. *Obviously Teams: England: Butland, Smith, Caulker, Dawson, Rose, Chalobah, Henderson, Lowe, Ince, Zaha, Redmond.

The man, who reportedly arrived in Norway with his family as a refugee in 1999, is said to be one of four men seen in CCTV footage released by Kenyan authorities. At least 67 people died in the Nairobi attack for which the al-Qaida-linked group al-Shabaab claimed responsibility. The BBCs Newsnight programme on Thursday said it had spoken to a relative of the Norwegian man, who said the man had left the town of Larvik for Somalia in 2009. The relative, who spoke to the programme on condition of anonymity, said the 23-year-old had made infrequent but increasingly erratic phone calls to the family. The most recent had been in the summer when he said he was in trouble and wanted to return home. On being shown the CCTV footage, the relative told Newsnight: I dont know what I feel or think  If it is him, he must have been brainwashed. The programme said a former neighbour of the family in Larvik said the man had been pretty extreme, didnt like life in Norway  got into trouble, fights, his father was worried. He said one person seen in the CCTV footage wearing a black shirt or jacket could be the man he had known. Stig Hansen, an expert on security and political Islam based in Norway, told Newsnight that an estimated 20-30 Norwegians had gone to Somalia to sign up for al-Shabaab. The biggest problem is the so-called Generation 1.5, those who werent born in Norway but came when they were quite young, falling between two cultures, he said. [Al-Shabaab] need people who are quite ignorant about Somalia. That is in their interest because that will give them a more internationalist agenda. And it might also make them more dangerous when they return back to their home countries. Last week Norways intelligence agency, the PST, said it was attempting to verify reports that a Norwegian citizen had been involved in the assault on the shopping centre, which lasted four days. We have lately seen an increase in the number of persons leaving Norway to take part in acts of war, attend training camps or join terrorist networks abroad, the Norwegian authorities said. We are concerned that this development may have an increasingly negative impact on the threat situation in Norway. A Kenyan al-Shabaab leader whom US commandos targeted in a raid in Somalia on 5 October, but failed to capture, reportedly may have spent time in Norway, according to the Norwegian station TV2. It said Abdukadir Mohamed Abdukadir, also known as Ikrima, had travelled to Norway and applied for asylum in 2004 but left in 2008 before receiving a decision on his application.

It is rising in silver splendour over the mountains that enfold their little town, casting a pool of bright light around them. In this new morning they cast shadows on the town square. Real shadows at last!</p> <p>But that is not the sun. It is a system of gigantic mirrors set up on the mountain to give Rjukan a sunlight boost.

As we chug slowly around in our boat the other sightseers are wrapped in blankets hunkered against the October chill. I sit in my shirt sleeves staring at the water, thinking how enticing it looks. Calm and blue and clear, it calls to me. I wonder how many islands there are, and what it might be like to swim around them all.</p> <p><strong>Day three:</strong> I am now itching to swim in the fjord. As we go about our sightseeing business I collect information from random strangers on where the locals swim in the summer, what the temperature of the water might be, and how we might get to the ""beach"". Everyone I ask about swimming in the fjord is astounded that I might be contemplating such an activity.</p> <p><strong>Day four:</strong> The water, I am informed, is around 13C. We set off to find the Oslo's ""beach"", which we are told is on ""Museum Island"" <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> aka Bygd<c3><83><c6><92><c3><82><c2><b8>y, a peninsula on the western side of the city. Apparently, in the summer, 3,000 people descend on there each day to swim. We set off on the No 30 bus, which takes us through the suburbs and out to Museum Island, where the <a href=""http://www.kon-tiki.no/e_aapning.php"" title="""">Kon-Tiki Museum</a> and the <a href=""http://www.khm.uio.no/english/visit-us/viking-ship-museum/"" title="""">Viking Ship Museum</a> are. We go right past them, staying on the bus as the other tourists get off. Ours is not the conventional tourist trail. We scour the wooded suburbs for signs of water and beach. Finally we succumb and ask the bus driver. ""We are looking for the beach. We want to swim."" ""You want to swim??"" The driver is incredulous but helpful. He points us in the direction of the shore and shows us the nudist beach for good measure <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> and tells us of a story about when he accidentally ended up on the nudist beach with his three-year-old son. ""Daddy, why are we the only ones with clothes on?""</p> <p>We studiously avoid the nudist beach and head down to the main strand. There are several small stony affairs with inlets and rocks and birds and the odd kayaker paddling in the water. There are the odd couple sitting bundled against the cold on benches. A mother watches her two young boys play on the rocks. The sky is a broody grey blue. It's spectacularly peaceful.</p> <p>We undress by the rocks. I carefully take off my clothes and repack them in the reverse order that I'll want to put them on again. When you're cold there's no time for faffing about. I lay my borrowed hotel towel on the top of the pile. It's not exactly a beach towel but it'll just about do. I have my costume on under my clothes so it's easy to strip off and head into the water. Hat, goggles, earplugs. I wave my cheery goodbye to my lovely and tolerant boyfriend and head into the water trying to not look too cold. We've agreed that I will go in first and have a little swim and then he will join. I'm used to the cold water but he isn't, so I can stay for longer than him.</p> <p>I wade in: it's quite chilly. It probably is around 13C. My feet are cold and I'm picking my way carefully through mussel shells in the water by the tide line. I try to look cheerful and confident. Put my hands into the water. Splash my face. Taste the water <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> slightly salty. My goggles are steaming up with the warmth of my face and the cold of the water. Finally I can't put it off any longer. I dive in and start swimming. The seabed drops away quickly and the water is dark. Eek. <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-swimming-blog/2013/aug/09/how-i-swam-english-channel?commentpage=1"" title="""">I know I'm a Channel swimmer and all that</a>, but new bits of water deserve to be treated with respect. I swim out in a gentle curve looking, and look down. There are shoals of small black fish darting around me. Fabulous. Then I see a large lone orange jellyfish. If there was ever anything to spoil the peace of a swim it's a jellyfish sighting. I swing wide and then swim more cautiously with more glances up and more scanning of the water. Fortunately it's clear and black and so easy to see through.</p> <p>I swim a wide arc back to the beach where my waiting boyfriend has now stripped off and is waiting at the water's edge. ""Be careful of the mussel shells,"" I call. He wades in stoically. A gasp of air and he plunges forward. Suddenly he is breastroking beside me. He doesn't like to put his head under. I offer my goggles so that he can see the shoal of fish below. He declines. Sometimes it's better not to look. We swim a little together. I corral him so that he avoids the jellyfish. I feel like a protective mother hen. The water is beautiful. There are birds perched on the rocks. People watch us from the shore, but the fjord is ours.</p> <p>We stay in for a few more minutes and then rush out and spend a good 20 minutes fumbling with cold hands trying to dress on the sand and rocks. What seemed like an improbable amount of extra warm clothes as we left the hotel seems just right now. We laugh and chatter excitedly and dress on the beach under too-small towels. My partner turns round and says proudly, with a big grin, ""I feel young."" Yes. Isn't that great? Younger, more alive, more free. We feel connected to that place, to Oslo, in a way that no museum trip will ever give you.</p>",2013,"Every swimmer knows they should never ever leave home without their swimming gear.

As we go about our sightseeing business I collect information from random strangers on where the locals swim in the summer, what the temperature of the water might be, and how we might get to the ""beach"". Everyone I ask about swimming in the fjord is astounded that I might be contemplating such an activity. Day four: The water, I am informed, is around 13C. We set off to find the Oslo's ""beach"", which we are told is on ""Museum Island""  aka Bygdy, a peninsula on the western side of the city. Apparently, in the summer, 3,000 people descend on there each day to swim. We set off on the No 30 bus, which takes us through the suburbs and out to Museum Island, where the Kon-Tiki Museum and the Viking Ship Museum are. We go right past them, staying on the bus as the other tourists get off. Ours is not the conventional tourist trail. We scour the wooded suburbs for signs of water and beach. Finally we succumb and ask the bus driver. ""We are looking for the beach. We want to swim."" ""You want to swim??"" The driver is incredulous but helpful. He points us in the direction of the shore and shows us the nudist beach for good measure  and tells us of a story about when he accidentally ended up on the nudist beach with his three-year-old son. ""Daddy, why are we the only ones with clothes on?"" We studiously avoid the nudist beach and head down to the main strand. There are several small stony affairs with inlets and rocks and birds and the odd kayaker paddling in the water. There are the odd couple sitting bundled against the cold on benches. A mother watches her two young boys play on the rocks. The sky is a broody grey blue. It's spectacularly peaceful. We undress by the rocks. I carefully take off my clothes and repack them in the reverse order that I'll want to put them on again. When you're cold there's no time for faffing about. I lay my borrowed hotel towel on the top of the pile. It's not exactly a beach towel but it'll just about do. I have my costume on under my clothes so it's easy to strip off and head into the water. Hat, goggles, earplugs. I wave my cheery goodbye to my lovely and tolerant boyfriend and head into the water trying to not look too cold. We've agreed that I will go in first and have a little swim and then he will join. I'm used to the cold water but he isn't, so I can stay for longer than him. I wade in: it's quite chilly. It probably is around 13C. My feet are cold and I'm picking my way carefully through mussel shells in the water by the tide line. I try to look cheerful and confident. Put my hands into the water. Splash my face. Taste the water  slightly salty. My goggles are steaming up with the warmth of my face and the cold of the water. Finally I can't put it off any longer. I dive in and start swimming. The seabed drops away quickly and the water is dark. Eek. I know I'm a Channel swimmer and all that, but new bits of water deserve to be treated with respect. I swim out in a gentle curve looking, and look down. There are shoals of small black fish darting around me. Fabulous. Then I see a large lone orange jellyfish. If there was ever anything to spoil the peace of a swim it's a jellyfish sighting. I swing wide and then swim more cautiously with more glances up and more scanning of the water. Fortunately it's clear and black and so easy to see through. I swim a wide arc back to the beach where my waiting boyfriend has now stripped off and is waiting at the water's edge. ""Be careful of the mussel shells,"" I call. He wades in stoically. A gasp of air and he plunges forward. Suddenly he is breastroking beside me. He doesn't like to put his head under. I offer my goggles so that he can see the shoal of fish below. He declines. Sometimes it's better not to look. We swim a little together. I corral him so that he avoids the jellyfish. I feel like a protective mother hen. The water is beautiful. There are birds perched on the rocks. People watch us from the shore, but the fjord is ours. We stay in for a few more minutes and then rush out and spend a good 20 minutes fumbling with cold hands trying to dress on the sand and rocks. What seemed like an improbable amount of extra warm clothes as we left the hotel seems just right now. We laugh and chatter excitedly and dress on the beach under too-small towels. My partner turns round and says proudly, with a big grin, ""I feel young."" Yes. Isn't that great? Younger, more alive, more free. We feel connected to that place, to Oslo, in a way that no museum trip will ever give you."

Six months of near darkness broken only by the howls of wolves and the tourists who came to see the Northern Lights but forgot that winter can be cloudy (the tourists that is, not the wolves). In Rjukan, a lovely Norwegian town located in the dramatic Vestfjord valley, the winter darkness was particularly hard to bear because they could see the sunshine touching the 1,883m tip of the local mountain, Gaustatoppen. Now thanks to an ingenious set of mirrors on the mountain, a great beam of sunlight is going to be directed into the town square. The area is well-known among Norwegians for its excellent cross-country skiing and ice-climbing  so from now on aprs ski will no doubt involve soaking up a few rays. Who will be the first person to get an Arctic winter tan, I wonder? Will it impress Londoners who sneer at any sunbeam that can't melt a car? The idea was first dreamed up exactly a century ago by local man Sam Eyde, but only now can the mirrors be precisely computer-controlled, creating a patch of sun about the size of three tennis courts.

Instead he became the governor of Bastoy prison island, the first ""human ecological prison"" in the world. Under Nilsen's tenure, Bastoy, home to some of the most serious offenders in Norway, has received increasing global attention both for the humane conditions under which the prisoners live <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> in houses rather than cells in what resembles a cosy self-sustaining village, or what the sceptics have often described as a ""holiday camp"" <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> and for its remarkably low reoffending rate of just 16% compared with around 70% for prisons across the rest of Europe and the US. Last year alone, the island, not much bigger than a breakwater in the Oslo fjord, played host to visitors from 25 international media organisations, all keen to find out the secret of Nilsen's success.</p> <p>This month, Nilsen steps down after five years in charge, but intends to continue influencing penal philosophy in an international context. Recently, he has been in Romania, where he helped establish therapeutic wings in three large prisons, advising the prison authorities as they establish their own human ecological prison along the lines of Bastoy on a small island in the Danube delta.</p> <p>""I run this prison like a small society,"" he says as we sip tea in his cramped but tidy office. ""I give respect to the prisoners who come here and they respond by respecting themselves, each other and this community."" It is this core philosophy that Nilsen, 62, believes is responsible for the success of Bastoy.</p> <p>On a <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/feb/25/norwegian-prison-inmates-treated-like-people"" title="""">previous visit</a> to Bastoy, I spoke to a number of prisoners serving long terms for murder, rape and other violent offences, and was struck by the air of optimism and hope they had of living constructive, contributing lives once their sentences were served. Among guards I noticed a glaring lack of cynicism and a genuine sense of pride in their work.</p> <p>""It is not just because Bastoy is a nice place, a pretty island to serve prison time, that people change,"" says Nilsen. ""The staff here are very important. They are like social workers as well as prison guards. They believe in their work and know the difference they are making.""</p> <p>I almost tell Nilsen about the British prison officer who, miffed when the governor of a high-security prison in Cambridge gave the prisoners in his care a 36p cream egg one Easter, told the Sun newspaper: ""We have to spend time away from our families to look after these vermin."" In fairness to him, that officer was only reflecting what he probably regarded as public opinion towards prisoners in this country. When I asked the female guard who drove me from the ferry landing to Nilsen's office about public attitudes to prisons and prisoners in Norway, she said that 90% of the public have no interest, ""so long as people come out better"".</p> <p>It is clear to anyone <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> when looking at the results of Nilsen's approach that by achieving its low reoffending rate <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> thereby reducing the number of future potential victims of released prisoners, Bastoy prison works. Prisoners can come here for the final part of their sentence if they show a commitment to live a crime-free life on release. Bastoy is also one of the cheapest prisons in Norway to run.</p> <p>But how do you get the man in the street to accept that treating people who have committed terrible crimes with respect and consideration is in his and his family's best interests.

""If someone did very serious harm to one of my daughters or my family ... I would probably want to kill them. That's my reaction. But as a prison governor, or politician, we have to approach this in a different way. We have to respect people's need for revenge, but not use that as a foundation for how we run our prisons. Many people here have done something stupid <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> they will not do it again. But prisons are also full of people who have all sorts of problems. Should I&#xa0;be in charge of adding more problems to the prisoner on behalf of the state, making you an even worse threat to larger society because I have treated you badly while you are in my care? We know that prison harms people. I look at this place as a place of healing, not just of your social wounds but of the wounds inflicted on you by the state in your four or five years in eight square metres of high security.""</p> <p>Nilsen was brought up on a farm run by his uncle near Trondheim. His father was a fisherman who often spent the spring months away at sea while his mother ran the home and looked after him and his two older siblings. He skied the 5km to school in the dark in the winter and cycled in the summer, and remembers his childhood with fondness. ""I grew up in a very loving home. I loved helping on the farm and, in the summer, helping my father on the boat. There was a lot of joy in our house.""</p> <p>When he was 17, he joined the Salvation Army, studying at officer training college <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> where he met his wife. A 16-year ministry followed, during which he spent a year in the UK working one day a week in Lewes prison. On his return to Oslo, he helped to establish and run an institution called Soldammen, geared specifically to helping young drug addicts. It was a wrench, he says, when, after deep thought, he decided the time had come for him to resign as an officer of the Salvation Army. He went on to work in a church mission establishing a centre to care for people with HIV, before going to Oslo University College to study governmental management. In his own time, he spent four years training as a Gestalt psychotherapist and later applied successfully for the position of chief probation officer in the south-east county, which was his opening into the correctional services.</p> <p>""I like to have power to influence,"" he says. ""For most of my working life I have held positions of leadership where I have had the power to influence people, I &#xa0;hope in a good way.""</p> <p>From probation, he went on to work in the ministry of justice where he spent 12&#xa0;years in various positions, taking charge of designing the content of prison regimes, working for the inspectorate and going on missions abroad, advising the ministries of Latvia, Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Russia and Georgia. In Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, he advised on reforms of the police, courts and prison system. It&#xa0;was there that he witnessed prison conditions where there was little room for humanity.</p> <p>""I saw a cell of about 30&#xa0;square metres holding more than 90 prisoners. They slept on bunk beds three high with just a hole in the concrete floor, covered with a blanket, for a toilet. They wore only underpants in the 40C heat. The smell was unimaginable. Some had been in there for two years or more .""</p> <p>He then took a year off to practise psychotherapy full-time, working with the prisoners on Bastoy Island. ""One of the most interesting challenges of my career,"" he says.</p> <p>When the then governor decided he was going to step down, he suggested Nilsen apply for the post. ""It felt like the right time and the right place to continue my work. In Norway, as in the UK and many other countries, we still think quite short-term, wanting to inflict revenge on criminals, wanting them to suffer for what they have done. But in most countries nearly all prisoners are going to be released. So what happens to them when they are in prison is very important.""</p> <p>He believes that politicians carry a huge responsibility for the number of people in prison around Europe and the commensurately high reoffending rates. ""They should deal with this by rethinking how they address the public regarding what is most effective in reducing reoffending. Losing liberty is sufficient punishment <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> once in custody we should focus on reducing the risk that offenders pose to society after they leave prison.

Everybody has to work. But we have free time so we can do some fishing, or in summer we can swim off the beach. We know we are prisoners but here we feel like people.""</p> <p>I wasn't sure what to expect on Bastoy. A number of wide-eyed commentators before me have variously described conditions under which the island's 115 prisoners live as ""cushy"", ""luxurious"" and, the old chestnut, ""like a holiday camp"". I'm sceptical of such media reports.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-image-404517498""> <img src=""https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/2/22/1361557603824/An-inmate-repairs-a-bike.-010.jpg"" alt=""An inmate repairs a bike."" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">An inmate repairs a bike. Photograph: Marco Di Lauro</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a life prisoner, I spent the first eight years of the 20 I served in a cell with a bed, a chair, a table and a bucket for my toilet. In that time I was caught up in a major riot, trapped in a siege and witnessed regular acts of serious violence. Across the prison estate, several hundred prisoners took their own lives, half a dozen of whom I knew personally <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> and a number were murdered. Yet the constant refrain from the popular press was that I, too, was living in a ""holiday camp"". When in-cell toilets were installed, and a few years later we were given small televisions, the ""luxury prison"" headlines intensified and for the rest of the time I was in prison, it never really abated.</p> <p>It always seemed to me while I was in jail that the real prison scandal was the horrendous rate of reoffending among released prisoners. In 2007, 14 prisons in England and Wales had reconvictions rates of more than 70%. At an average cost of <c3><83><e2><80><9a><c3><82><c2><a3>40,000 a year for each prisoner, this amounts to a huge investment in failure <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> and a total lack of consideration for potential future victims of released prisoners. That's the reason I'm keen to have a look at what has been hailed as the world's first ""human ecological prison"".</p> <p>Thorbjorn, a 58-year-old guard who has worked on Bastoy for 17 years, gives me a warm welcome as I step on to dry land. As we walk along the icy, snowbound track that leads to the admin block, he tells me how the prison operates. There are 70 members of staff on the 2.6 sq km island during the day, 35 of whom are uniformed guards. Their main job is to count the prisoners <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> first thing in the morning, twice during the day at their workplaces, once en masse at a specific assembly point at 5pm, and finally at 11pm, when they are confined to their respective houses. Only four guards remain on the island after 4pm. Thorbjorn points out the small, brightly painted wooden bungalows dotted around the wintry landscape. ""These are the houses for the prisoners,"" he says. They accommodate up to six people. Every man has his own room and they share kitchen and other facilities. ""The idea is they get used to living as they will live when they are released."" Only one meal a day is provided in the dining hall. The men earn the equivalent of <c3><83><e2><80><9a><c3><82><c2><a3>6 a day and are given a food allowance each month of around <c3><83><e2><80><9a><c3><82><c2><a3>70 with which to buy provisions for their self-prepared breakfasts and evening meals from the island's well-stocked mini-supermarket.</p> <p>I can see why some people might think such conditions controversial. The common understanding of prison is that it is a place of deprivation and penance rather than domestic comfort.</p> <p>Prisoners in Norway can apply for a transfer to Bastoy when they have up to five years left of their sentence to serve. Every type of offender, including men convicted of murder or rape, may be accepted, so long as they fit the criteria, the main one being a determination to live a crime-free life on release.</p> <p>I ask Thorbjorn what work the prisoners do on the island. He tells me about the farm where prisoners tend sheep, cows and chickens, or grow fruit and vegetables. ""They grow much of their own food,"" he says.</p> <p>Other jobs are available in the laundry; in the stables looking after the horses that pull the island's cart transport; in the bicycle repair shop, (many of the prisoners have their own bikes, bought with their own money); on ground maintenance or in the timber workshop. The working day begins at 8.30am and already I can hear the buzz of chainsaws and heavy-duty strimmers. We walk past a group of red phone boxes from where prisoners can call family and friends. A large building to our left is where weekly visits take place, in private family rooms where conjugal relations are allowed.</p> <p>After the security officer signs me in and takes my mobile, Thorbjorn delivers me to governor Arne Nilsen's office. ""Let me tell you something,"" Thorbjorn says before leaving me. ""You know, on this island I feel safer than when I walk on the streets in Oslo.""</p> <p>Through Nilsen's window I can see the church, the school and the library. Life for the prisoners is as normal as it is possible to be in a prison. It feels rather like a religious commune; there is a sense of peace about the place, although the absence of women (apart from some uniformed guards) and children is noticeable. Nilsen has coined a phrase for his prison: ""an arena of developing responsibility."" He pours me a cup of tea.</p> <p>""In closed prisons we keep them locked up for some years and then let them back out, not having had any real responsibility for working or cooking. In the law, being sent to prison is nothing to do with putting you in a terrible prison to make you suffer. The punishment is that you lose your freedom. If we treat people like animals when they are in prison they are likely to behave like animals. Here we pay attention to you as human beings.""</p> <p>A clinical psychologist by profession, Nilsen shrugs off any notion that he is running a holiday camp. I sense his frustration. ""You don't change people by power,"" he says. ""For the victim, the offender is in prison. That is justice. I'm not stupid. I'm a realist. Here I give prisoners respect; this way we teach them to respect others. But we are watching them all the time. It is important that when they are released they are less likely to commit more crimes. That is justice for society.""</p> <p>The reoffending rate for those released from Bastoy speaks for itself. At just 16%, it is the lowest in Europe. But who are the prisoners on Bastoy? Are they the goodie-goodies of the system?</p> <p>Hessle is 23 years old and serving 11 years for murder. ""It was a revenge killing,"" he says. ""I wish I had not done it, but now I must pay for my crime."" Slight and fair-haired, he says he has been in and out of penal institutions since he was 15. Drugs have blighted his life and driven his criminality. There are three golden rules on Bastoy: no violence, no alcohol and no drugs. Here, he works in the stables tending the horses and has nearly four years left to serve. How does he see the future? ""Now I have no desire for drugs. When I get out I want to live and have a family. Here I am learning to be able to do that.""</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-image-404517499""> <img src=""https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/2/22/1361557479903/A-convict-works-on-Bastoy-010.jpg"" alt=""A convict works on Bastoy prison farm."" width=""460"" height=""276"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">A convict works on Bastoy prison farm. Photograph: Marco Di Lauro</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hessle plays the guitar and is rehearsing with other prisoners in the Bastoy Blues Band. Last year they were given permission to attend a music festival as a support act that ZZ Top headlined. Bjorn is the band's teacher. Once a Bastoy prisoner who served five years for attacking his wife in a ""moment of madness"", he now returns once a week to teach guitar. ""I know the potential for people here to change,"" he says.</p> <p>Formerly a social researcher, he has formed links with construction companies he previously worked for that have promised to consider employing band members if they can demonstrate reliability and commitment. ""This is not just about the music,"" he says, ""it's about giving people a chance to prove their worth.""</p> <p>Sven, another band member, was also convicted of murder, and sentenced to eight years. The 29-year-old was an unemployed labourer before his conviction. He works in the timber yard and is waiting to see if his application to be ""house father"" in his five-man bungalow is successful. ""I like the responsibility,"" he says. ""Before coming here I never really cared for other people.""</p> <p>The female guard who introduces me to the band is called Rutchie. ""I'm very proud to be a guard here, and my family are very proud of me,"" she says. It takes three years to train to be a prison guard in Norway. She looks at me with disbelief when I tell her that in the UK prison officer training is just six weeks. ""There is so much to learn about the people who come to prison,"" she says. ""We need to try to understand how they became criminals, and then help them to change. I'm still learning.""</p> <p>Finally, I'm introduced to Vidor, who at 72 is the oldest prisoner on the island. He works in the laundry and is the house father of his four-man bungalow. I haven't asked any of the prisoners about their crimes. The information has been offered voluntarily. Vidor does the same. He tells me he is serving 15 years for double manslaughter. There is a deep sadness in his eyes, even when he smiles. ""Killers like me have nowhere to hide,"" he says. He tells me that in the aftermath of his crimes he was ""on the floor"". He cried a lot at first. ""If there was the death penalty I would have said, yes please, take me."" He says he was helped in prison. ""They helped me to understand why I did what I did and helped me to live again."" Now he studies philosophy, in particular Nietzsche. ""I'm glad they let me come here. It is a healthy place to be. I'll be 74 when I get out,"" he says. ""I'll be happy if I can get to 84, and then just say: 'Bye-bye.'""</p> <p>On the ferry back to the mainland I think about what I have seen and heard. Bastoy is no holiday camp. In some ways I feel as if I've seen a vision of the future <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> a penal institution designed to heal rather than harm and to generate hope instead of despair. I believe all societies will always need high-security prisons. But there needs to be a robust filtering procedure along the lines of the Norwegian model, in order that the process is not more damaging than necessary. As Nilsen asserts, justice for society demands that people we release from prison should be less likely to cause further harm or distress to others, and better equipped to live as law-abiding citizens.</p> <p>It would take much political courage and social confidence to spread the penal philosophy of Bastoy outside Norway, however. In the meantime, I hope the decision-makers of the world take note of the revolution in rehabilitation that is occurring on that tiny island.</p>",2013,"The first clue that things are done very differently on Bastoy prison island, which lies a couple of miles off the coast in the Oslo fjord, 46 miles south-east of Norway's capital, comes shortly after I board the prison ferry.

I'm sceptical of such media reports. As a life prisoner, I spent the first eight years of the 20 I served in a cell with a bed, a chair, a table and a bucket for my toilet. In that time I was caught up in a major riot, trapped in a siege and witnessed regular acts of serious violence. Across the prison estate, several hundred prisoners took their own lives, half a dozen of whom I knew personally  and a number were murdered. Yet the constant refrain from the popular press was that I, too, was living in a ""holiday camp"". When in-cell toilets were installed, and a few years later we were given small televisions, the ""luxury prison"" headlines intensified and for the rest of the time I was in prison, it never really abated. It always seemed to me while I was in jail that the real prison scandal was the horrendous rate of reoffending among released prisoners. In 2007, 14 prisons in England and Wales had reconvictions rates of more than 70%. At an average cost of 40,000 a year for each prisoner, this amounts to a huge investment in failure  and a total lack of consideration for potential future victims of released prisoners. That's the reason I'm keen to have a look at what has been hailed as the world's first ""human ecological prison"". Thorbjorn, a 58-year-old guard who has worked on Bastoy for 17 years, gives me a warm welcome as I step on to dry land. As we walk along the icy, snowbound track that leads to the admin block, he tells me how the prison operates. There are 70 members of staff on the 2.6 sq km island during the day, 35 of whom are uniformed guards. Their main job is to count the prisoners  first thing in the morning, twice during the day at their workplaces, once en masse at a specific assembly point at 5pm, and finally at 11pm, when they are confined to their respective houses. Only four guards remain on the island after 4pm. Thorbjorn points out the small, brightly painted wooden bungalows dotted around the wintry landscape. ""These are the houses for the prisoners,"" he says. They accommodate up to six people. Every man has his own room and they share kitchen and other facilities. ""The idea is they get used to living as they will live when they are released."" Only one meal a day is provided in the dining hall. The men earn the equivalent of 6 a day and are given a food allowance each month of around 70 with which to buy provisions for their self-prepared breakfasts and evening meals from the island's well-stocked mini-supermarket. I can see why some people might think such conditions controversial. The common understanding of prison is that it is a place of deprivation and penance rather than domestic comfort. Prisoners in Norway can apply for a transfer to Bastoy when they have up to five years left of their sentence to serve. Every type of offender, including men convicted of murder or rape, may be accepted, so long as they fit the criteria, the main one being a determination to live a crime-free life on release. I ask Thorbjorn what work the prisoners do on the island. He tells me about the farm where prisoners tend sheep, cows and chickens, or grow fruit and vegetables. ""They grow much of their own food,"" he says. Other jobs are available in the laundry; in the stables looking after the horses that pull the island's cart transport; in the bicycle repair shop, (many of the prisoners have their own bikes, bought with their own money); on ground maintenance or in the timber workshop. The working day begins at 8.30am and already I can hear the buzz of chainsaws and heavy-duty strimmers. We walk past a group of red phone boxes from where prisoners can call family and friends. A large building to our left is where weekly visits take place, in private family rooms where conjugal relations are allowed. After the security officer signs me in and takes my mobile, Thorbjorn delivers me to governor Arne Nilsen's office. ""Let me tell you something,"" Thorbjorn says before leaving me. ""You know, on this island I feel safer than when I walk on the streets in Oslo."" Through Nilsen's window I can see the church, the school and the library. Life for the prisoners is as normal as it is possible to be in a prison. It feels rather like a religious commune; there is a sense of peace about the place, although the absence of women (apart from some uniformed guards) and children is noticeable. Nilsen has coined a phrase for his prison: ""an arena of developing responsibility."" He pours me a cup of tea. ""In closed prisons we keep them locked up for some years and then let them back out, not having had any real responsibility for working or cooking. In the law, being sent to prison is nothing to do with putting you in a terrible prison to make you suffer. The punishment is that you lose your freedom. If we treat people like animals when they are in prison they are likely to behave like animals. Here we pay attention to you as human beings."" A clinical psychologist by profession, Nilsen shrugs off any notion that he is running a holiday camp. I sense his frustration. ""You don't change people by power,"" he says. ""For the victim, the offender is in prison. That is justice. I'm not stupid. I'm a realist. Here I give prisoners respect; this way we teach them to respect others. But we are watching them all the time. It is important that when they are released they are less likely to commit more crimes. That is justice for society."" The reoffending rate for those released from Bastoy speaks for itself. At just 16%, it is the lowest in Europe. But who are the prisoners on Bastoy? Are they the goodie-goodies of the system? Hessle is 23 years old and serving 11 years for murder. ""It was a revenge killing,"" he says. ""I wish I had not done it, but now I must pay for my crime."" Slight and fair-haired, he says he has been in and out of penal institutions since he was 15. Drugs have blighted his life and driven his criminality. There are three golden rules on Bastoy: no violence, no alcohol and no drugs. Here, he works in the stables tending the horses and has nearly four years left to serve. How does he see the future? ""Now I have no desire for drugs. When I get out I want to live and have a family. Here I am learning to be able to do that."" Hessle plays the guitar and is rehearsing with other prisoners in the Bastoy Blues Band. Last year they were given permission to attend a music festival as a support act that ZZ Top headlined. Bjorn is the band's teacher. Once a Bastoy prisoner who served five years for attacking his wife in a ""moment of madness"", he now returns once a week to teach guitar. ""I know the potential for people here to change,"" he says. Formerly a social researcher, he has formed links with construction companies he previously worked for that have promised to consider employing band members if they can demonstrate reliability and commitment. ""This is not just about the music,"" he says, ""it's about giving people a chance to prove their worth."" Sven, another band member, was also convicted of murder, and sentenced to eight years. The 29-year-old was an unemployed labourer before his conviction. He works in the timber yard and is waiting to see if his application to be ""house father"" in his five-man bungalow is successful. ""I like the responsibility,"" he says. ""Before coming here I never really cared for other people."" The female guard who introduces me to the band is called Rutchie. ""I'm very proud to be a guard here, and my family are very proud of me,"" she says. It takes three years to train to be a prison guard in Norway. She looks at me with disbelief when I tell her that in the UK prison officer training is just six weeks. ""There is so much to learn about the people who come to prison,"" she says. ""We need to try to understand how they became criminals, and then help them to change. I'm still learning."" Finally, I'm introduced to Vidor, who at 72 is the oldest prisoner on the island. He works in the laundry and is the house father of his four-man bungalow. I haven't asked any of the prisoners about their crimes. The information has been offered voluntarily. Vidor does the same. He tells me he is serving 15 years for double manslaughter. There is a deep sadness in his eyes, even when he smiles. ""Killers like me have nowhere to hide,"" he says. He tells me that in the aftermath of his crimes he was ""on the floor"". He cried a lot at first. ""If there was the death penalty I would have said, yes please, take me."" He says he was helped in prison. ""They helped me to understand why I did what I did and helped me to live again."" Now he studies philosophy, in particular Nietzsche. ""I'm glad they let me come here. It is a healthy place to be. I'll be 74 when I get out,"" he says. ""I'll be happy if I can get to 84, and then just say: 'Bye-bye.'"" On the ferry back to the mainland I think about what I have seen and heard. Bastoy is no holiday camp. In some ways I feel as if I've seen a vision of the future  a penal institution designed to heal rather than harm and to generate hope instead of despair. I believe all societies will always need high-security prisons. But there needs to be a robust filtering procedure along the lines of the Norwegian model, in order that the process is not more damaging than necessary. As Nilsen asserts, justice for society demands that people we release from prison should be less likely to cause further harm or distress to others, and better equipped to live as law-abiding citizens. It would take much political courage and social confidence to spread the penal philosophy of Bastoy outside Norway, however. In the meantime, I hope the decision-makers of the world take note of the revolution in rehabilitation that is occurring on that tiny island."

Knut Bjarkeid, the director of Ila prison where Breivik is being held, told Norwegian journalists: ""The prison will always try to pave the way for the inmates to get a formal education, so that they are able to get a job when they come out."" In November, Breivik wrote a long letter complaining about the conditions in which he was being held, describing the pen he was forced to write with as ""an almost indescribable manifestation of sadism""."

High on the mountain opposite, 450 metres above the town, three large, solar-powered, computer-controlled mirrors steadily track the movement of the sun across the sky, reflecting its rays down on to the square and bathing it in bright sunlight.

A retired secretary, Sparbo has lived all her life in Rjukan and says people ""do sort of get used to the shade. You end up not thinking about it, really. But this ... This is so warming. Not just physically, but mentally. It's mentally warming.""</p> <p>Two young mothers wheel their children into the square, turn, and briefly bask: a quick hit. On a freezing day, an elderly couple sit wide-eyed on one of the half-dozen newly installed benches, smiling at the warmth on their faces. Children beam. Lots of people take photographs. A shop assistant, Silje Johansen, says it's ""awesome. Just awesome.""</p> <p>Pushing his child's buggy, electrical engineer Eivind Toreid is more cautious. ""It's a funny thing,"" he says. ""Not real sunlight, but very like it. Like a spotlight. I'll go if I'm free and in town, yes. Especially in autumn and in the weeks before the sun comes back. Those are the worst: you look just a short way up the mountainside and the sun is right there, so close you can almost touch it.

Heidi Fieldheim, who lives in Oslo now but spent six years in Rjukan with her husband, a local man, says she heard all about it on the radio. ""But it's far more than I expected,"" she says. ""This will bring much happiness.""</p> <p>Across the road in the Nyetider cafe, sporting <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> by happy coincidence <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> a particularly fine set of mutton chops, sits the man responsible for this unexpected access to happiness. Martin Andersen is a 40-year-old artist and lifeguard at the municipal baths who, after spells in Berlin, Paris, Mali and Oslo, pitched up in Rjukan in the summer of 2001.</p> <p>The first inkling of an artwork Andersen dubbed the Solspeil, or sun mirror, came to him as the month of September began to fade: ""Every day, we would take our young child for a walk in the buggy,"" he says, ""and every day I realised we were having to go a little further down the valley to find the sun."" By 28 September, Andersen realised, the sun completely disappears from Rjukan's market square. The occasion of its annual reappearance, lighting up the bridge across the river by the old fire station, is a date indelibly engraved in the minds of all Rjukan residents: 12 March.</p> <p>And throughout the seemingly endless intervening months, Andersen says: ""We'd look up and see blue sky above, and the sun high on the mountain slopes, but the only way we could get to it was to go out of town. The brighter the day, the darker it was down here. And it's sad, a town that people have to leave in order to feel the sun.""</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-image-423433593""> <img src=""https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/6/1383757776300/Sunlight-reflects-off-the-001.jpg"" alt=""Sunlight reflects off the three giant mirrors."" width=""460"" height=""690"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">Sunlight reflects off the three giant mirrors. Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A hundred years ago, Eyde had already grasped the gravity of the problem. Researching his own plan, Andersen discovered that, as early as 1913, Eyde was considering a suggestion by one of his factory workers for a system of mountain-top mirrors to redirect sunlight into the valley below.</p> <p>The industrialist eventually abandoned the plan for want of adequate technology, but soon afterwards his company, Norsk Hydro, paid for the construction of a cable car to carry the long-suffering townsfolk, for a modest sum, nearly 500m higher up the mountain and into the sunlight. (Built in 1928, the <a href=""http://www.krossobanen.no/"" title="""">Krossobanen</a> is still running, incidentally; <c3><83><e2><80><9a><c3><82><c2><a3>10 for the return trip. The view is majestic and the coffee at the top excellent. A brass plaque in the ticket office declares the facility a gift from the company ""to the people of Rjukan, because for six months of the year, the sun does not shine in the bottom of the valley"".)</p> <p>Andersen unearthed a partially covered sports stadium in Arizona that was successfully using small mirrors to keep its grass growing. He learned that in the Middle East and other sun-baked regions of the world, vast banks of hi-tech tracking mirrors called heliostats concentrate sufficient reflected sunlight to heat steam turbines and drive whole power plants. He persuaded the town hall to come up with the cash to allow him to develop his project further. He contacted an expert in the field, Jonny Nersveen, who did the maths and told him it could probably work. He visited Viganella, an Italian village that installed a similar sun mirror in 2006.</p> <p>And 12 years after he first dreamed of his Solspeil, a German company specialising in so-called CSP <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> concentrated solar power <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> helicoptered in the three 17 sq m glass mirrors that now stand high above the market square in Rjukan. ""It took,"" he says, ""a bit longer than we'd imagined."" First, the municipality wasn't used to dealing with this kind of project: ""There's no rubber stamp for a sun mirror."" But Andersen also wanted to be sure it was right <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> that Rjukan's sun mirror would do what it was intended to do.</p> <p>Viganella's single polished steel mirror, he says, lights a much larger area, but with a far weaker, more diffuse light. ""I wanted a smaller, concentrated patch of sunlight: a special sunlit spot in the middle of town where people could come for a quick five minutes in the sun."" The result, you would have to say, is pretty much exactly that: bordered on one side by the library and town hall, and on the other by the tourist office, the 600 sq ms of Rjukan's market square, to be comprehensively remodelled next year in celebration, now bathes in a focused beam of bright sunlight fully 80-90% as intense as the original.</p> <p>Their efforts monitored by webcams up on the mountain and down in the square, their movement dictated by computer in a Bavarian town outside Munich, the heliostats generate the solar power they need to gradually tilt and rotate, following the sun on its brief winter dash across the sky.</p> <p>It really works. Even the objectors <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> and there were, in town, plenty of them; petitions and letter-writing campaigns and a Facebook page organised against what a large number of locals saw initially as a vanity project and, above all, a criminal waste of money <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> now seem largely won over.</p>  <figure class=""element element-image"" data-media-id=""gu-image-423433594""> <img src=""https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/11/6/1383757703313/A-man-holds-his-baby-up-t-001.jpg"" alt=""A man holds his baby up to the light reflected by the mirrors."" width=""460"" height=""690"" class=""gu-image"" /> <figcaption> <span class=""element-image__caption"">A man holds his baby up to the light reflected by the mirrors. Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>""I was strongly against it,"" admits Nils Eggerud, a Norsk Hydro employee for 50 years and now retired. Like many others, he felt the money could have been better spent elsewhere <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> on a couple of extra carers to look after Rjukan's old people, perhaps, or improved school facilities, cycle paths, a bit of rural road resurfacing.</p> <p>""And I still have my doubts about the ongoing maintenance costs,"" he cautions. ""What will they be, who will pay them? But ... Well, it does feel nice, standing here. And really, you just have to look at the people's faces.""</p> <p>Anette Oien, too, was ""deeply sceptical"" to start with. Today, though, she marches cheerily across Sam Eyde Street for all the world as if heading for the beach, sits on a bench, lights up a cigarette, and lifts her face to the light. ""I miss the sun here in winter terribly,"" she says. ""It can be so hard. This is the light I long for.""</p> <p>Odd, though, the strength of that initial opposition. Beyond the valley, in Oslo and much further afield, Rjukan's hi-tech sun mirror has kindled nothing but enthusiasm; the project's official opening last week, complete with shades, sun-loungers, cocktails and beach volleyball, made newspaper headlines and news bulletins around the world. But Rjukan itself, until then, was stolidly unimpressed. Andersen's theory, which he readily admits ""may not prove very popular"", is that it wasn't about money at all. (In any case, he points out, helped by assorted government grants and a lump sum from Norsk Hydro, the municipality needed to find just 1m krone <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> <c3><83><e2><80><9a><c3><82><c2><a3>100,000 <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> of the mirror's total 5m krone cost.)</p> <p>""What it was, I think,"" he says, ""is that living in the shade must make you afraid to dream of the sun. That's the only way I can explain the resistance: like the valley walls, minds without sun become somehow a little bit narrower.""</p> <p>In his office overlooking the square, Rjukan's energetic young mayor, Steinar Bergsland, is interested not so much in the cost but in the benefits the mirror might bring to the town. Thanks to sound planning and government investment, Rjukan has survived the loss of much of its original heavy industry relatively unscathed. But the small town could do with the money.</p> <p>Already, Bergsland says, visitor numbers are up for the time of year and last weekend Rjukan's shopkeepers reported their takings following suit. Only this morning, the mayor took a call from a hi-tech company interested in relocating to Rjukkan, attracted by the cutting-edge technology on view at the top of the mountain and the publicity it has attracted.</p> <p>""This is a powerful symbol for Rjukan,"" Bergsland says. ""The whole history of this town is about new and crazy ideas; about Sam Eyde saying: 'OK, I'm going to tame the water and generate power and build a town and make a product from air and water that the whole world will buy.' This fits.""</p> <p>And seen against the municipality's 650m krone annual budget, he points out, 1m krone really wasn't very much to pay for something that ""gives us a far, far better chance of raising the money we need for better schools and more nursing care. And just look out of the window. Look at those happy faces. Now it's actually here, people love it.""</p> <p>Few on the streets seem to dissent (although Tarjei Steffensen Stortland, a 16-year-old student, still reckons the roads round where he lives could do with some attention). And Rjukan, best known for the wartime heroics of 12 SOE-trained Norwegian commandos who in 1943 destroyed a Nazi-occupied Norsk Hydro heavy water plant at nearby Vermok, thwarting Hitler's atomic bomb ambitions, undeniably has a new claim to fame.</p> <p>But is the Solspeil, as it was at least originally conceived, art? ""The people here don't see it that way,"" says Daniel Paida Larsen, a Rjukan-born, Berlin-based artist and close friend of Andersen's. ""They see it <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> and, thankfully, now welcome it <c3><83><c2><a2><c3><82><e2><82><ac><c3><82><e2><80><9c> as a technical project. Or a marketing tool.""</p> <p>But the sun mirror, nonetheless, is art, he says. ""I don't know how exactly I'd define it,"" Larsen says. ""An installation? A sculpture? It makes me think about how we need the sun, what happens to light when you reflect it. But what's really special is that it goes so deep into the public sphere. It touches something absolutely fundamental in this town.""</p> <p>At high school in Rjukan, Larsen remembers ""walking down the street and looking up and seeing sunshine and blue sky and thinking: why can't I be there?"" In the end, he says, ""the only way to cope is to ignore that. To survive here in winter, you have to ignore the possibility of the sun.""</p> <p>But no longer. Now there's the Solspeil. ""A work of art,"" Larsen says, ""with a real, vital function, fulfilling a basic need in people's lives."" Down on the square, Ingunn Sparbo might not put it in quite those terms, but she can't agree more.</p> <p>""Look at this!"" she says, almost beside herself. ""Who'd have thought it? I've stepped out to get a bit of sun.""</p>",2013,"On the market square in Rjukan stands a statue of the town's founder, a noted Norwegian engineer and industrialist called Sam Eyde, sporting a particularly fine moustache. One hand thrust in trouser pocket, the other grasping a tightly rolled drawing, the great man stares northwards across the square at an almost sheer mountainside in front of him.

A bit ... flat. A bit subdued, a bit muted, a bit mono. Since last week, however, Eyde's statue has gazed out upon a sight that even the eminent engineer might have found startling. High on the mountain opposite, 450 metres above the town, three large, solar-powered, computer-controlled mirrors steadily track the movement of the sun across the sky, reflecting its rays down on to the square and bathing it in bright sunlight. Rjukan  or at least, a small but vital part of Rjukan  is no longer stuck where the sun don't shine. ""It's the sun!"" grins Ingrid Sparbo, disbelievingly, lifting her face to the light and closing her eyes against the glare. A retired secretary, Sparbo has lived all her life in Rjukan and says people ""do sort of get used to the shade. You end up not thinking about it, really. But this ... This is so warming. Not just physically, but mentally. It's mentally warming."" Two young mothers wheel their children into the square, turn, and briefly bask: a quick hit. On a freezing day, an elderly couple sit wide-eyed on one of the half-dozen newly installed benches, smiling at the warmth on their faces. Children beam. Lots of people take photographs. A shop assistant, Silje Johansen, says it's ""awesome. Just awesome."" Pushing his child's buggy, electrical engineer Eivind Toreid is more cautious. ""It's a funny thing,"" he says. ""Not real sunlight, but very like it. Like a spotlight. I'll go if I'm free and in town, yes. Especially in autumn and in the weeks before the sun comes back. Those are the worst: you look just a short way up the mountainside and the sun is right there, so close you can almost touch it. But not here."" Pensioners Valborg and Eigil Lima have driven from Stavanger  five long hours on the road  specially to see it. Heidi Fieldheim, who lives in Oslo now but spent six years in Rjukan with her husband, a local man, says she heard all about it on the radio. ""But it's far more than I expected,"" she says. ""This will bring much happiness."" Across the road in the Nyetider cafe, sporting  by happy coincidence  a particularly fine set of mutton chops, sits the man responsible for this unexpected access to happiness. Martin Andersen is a 40-year-old artist and lifeguard at the municipal baths who, after spells in Berlin, Paris, Mali and Oslo, pitched up in Rjukan in the summer of 2001. The first inkling of an artwork Andersen dubbed the Solspeil, or sun mirror, came to him as the month of September began to fade: ""Every day, we would take our young child for a walk in the buggy,"" he says, ""and every day I realised we were having to go a little further down the valley to find the sun."" By 28 September, Andersen realised, the sun completely disappears from Rjukan's market square. The occasion of its annual reappearance, lighting up the bridge across the river by the old fire station, is a date indelibly engraved in the minds of all Rjukan residents: 12 March. And throughout the seemingly endless intervening months, Andersen says: ""We'd look up and see blue sky above, and the sun high on the mountain slopes, but the only way we could get to it was to go out of town. The brighter the day, the darker it was down here. And it's sad, a town that people have to leave in order to feel the sun."" A hundred years ago, Eyde had already grasped the gravity of the problem. Researching his own plan, Andersen discovered that, as early as 1913, Eyde was considering a suggestion by one of his factory workers for a system of mountain-top mirrors to redirect sunlight into the valley below. The industrialist eventually abandoned the plan for want of adequate technology, but soon afterwards his company, Norsk Hydro, paid for the construction of a cable car to carry the long-suffering townsfolk, for a modest sum, nearly 500m higher up the mountain and into the sunlight. (Built in 1928, the Krossobanen is still running, incidentally; 10 for the return trip. The view is majestic and the coffee at the top excellent. A brass plaque in the ticket office declares the facility a gift from the company ""to the people of Rjukan, because for six months of the year, the sun does not shine in the bottom of the valley"".) Andersen unearthed a partially covered sports stadium in Arizona that was successfully using small mirrors to keep its grass growing. He learned that in the Middle East and other sun-baked regions of the world, vast banks of hi-tech tracking mirrors called heliostats concentrate sufficient reflected sunlight to heat steam turbines and drive whole power plants. He persuaded the town hall to come up with the cash to allow him to develop his project further. He contacted an expert in the field, Jonny Nersveen, who did the maths and told him it could probably work. He visited Viganella, an Italian village that installed a similar sun mirror in 2006. And 12 years after he first dreamed of his Solspeil, a German company specialising in so-called CSP  concentrated solar power  helicoptered in the three 17 sq m glass mirrors that now stand high above the market square in Rjukan. ""It took,"" he says, ""a bit longer than we'd imagined."" First, the municipality wasn't used to dealing with this kind of project: ""There's no rubber stamp for a sun mirror."" But Andersen also wanted to be sure it was right  that Rjukan's sun mirror would do what it was intended to do. Viganella's single polished steel mirror, he says, lights a much larger area, but with a far weaker, more diffuse light. ""I wanted a smaller, concentrated patch of sunlight: a special sunlit spot in the middle of town where people could come for a quick five minutes in the sun."" The result, you would have to say, is pretty much exactly that: bordered on one side by the library and town hall, and on the other by the tourist office, the 600 sq ms of Rjukan's market square, to be comprehensively remodelled next year in celebration, now bathes in a focused beam of bright sunlight fully 80-90% as intense as the original. Their efforts monitored by webcams up on the mountain and down in the square, their movement dictated by computer in a Bavarian town outside Munich, the heliostats generate the solar power they need to gradually tilt and rotate, following the sun on its brief winter dash across the sky. It really works. Even the objectors  and there were, in town, plenty of them; petitions and letter-writing campaigns and a Facebook page organised against what a large number of locals saw initially as a vanity project and, above all, a criminal waste of money  now seem largely won over. ""I was strongly against it,"" admits Nils Eggerud, a Norsk Hydro employee for 50 years and now retired. Like many others, he felt the money could have been better spent elsewhere  on a couple of extra carers to look after Rjukan's old people, perhaps, or improved school facilities, cycle paths, a bit of rural road resurfacing. ""And I still have my doubts about the ongoing maintenance costs,"" he cautions. ""What will they be, who will pay them? But ... Well, it does feel nice, standing here. And really, you just have to look at the people's faces."" Anette Oien, too, was ""deeply sceptical"" to start with. Today, though, she marches cheerily across Sam Eyde Street for all the world as if heading for the beach, sits on a bench, lights up a cigarette, and lifts her face to the light. ""I miss the sun here in winter terribly,"" she says. ""It can be so hard. This is the light I long for."" Odd, though, the strength of that initial opposition. Beyond the valley, in Oslo and much further afield, Rjukan's hi-tech sun mirror has kindled nothing but enthusiasm; the project's official opening last week, complete with shades, sun-loungers, cocktails and beach volleyball, made newspaper headlines and news bulletins around the world. But Rjukan itself, until then, was stolidly unimpressed. Andersen's theory, which he readily admits ""may not prove very popular"", is that it wasn't about money at all. (In any case, he points out, helped by assorted government grants and a lump sum from Norsk Hydro, the municipality needed to find just 1m krone  100,000  of the mirror's total 5m krone cost.) ""What it was, I think,"" he says, ""is that living in the shade must make you afraid to dream of the sun. That's the only way I can explain the resistance: like the valley walls, minds without sun become somehow a little bit narrower."" In his office overlooking the square, Rjukan's energetic young mayor, Steinar Bergsland, is interested not so much in the cost but in the benefits the mirror might bring to the town. Thanks to sound planning and government investment, Rjukan has survived the loss of much of its original heavy industry relatively unscathed. But the small town could do with the money. Already, Bergsland says, visitor numbers are up for the time of year and last weekend Rjukan's shopkeepers reported their takings following suit. Only this morning, the mayor took a call from a hi-tech company interested in relocating to Rjukkan, attracted by the cutting-edge technology on view at the top of the mountain and the publicity it has attracted. ""This is a powerful symbol for Rjukan,"" Bergsland says. ""The whole history of this town is about new and crazy ideas; about Sam Eyde saying: 'OK, I'm going to tame the water and generate power and build a town and make a product from air and water that the whole world will buy.' This fits."" And seen against the municipality's 650m krone annual budget, he points out, 1m krone really wasn't very much to pay for something that ""gives us a far, far better chance of raising the money we need for better schools and more nursing care. And just look out of the window. Look at those happy faces. Now it's actually here, people love it."" Few on the streets seem to dissent (although Tarjei Steffensen Stortland, a 16-year-old student, still reckons the roads round where he lives could do with some attention). And Rjukan, best known for the wartime heroics of 12 SOE-trained Norwegian commandos who in 1943 destroyed a Nazi-occupied Norsk Hydro heavy water plant at nearby Vermok, thwarting Hitler's atomic bomb ambitions, undeniably has a new claim to fame. But is the Solspeil, as it was at least originally conceived, art? ""The people here don't see it that way,"" says Daniel Paida Larsen, a Rjukan-born, Berlin-based artist and close friend of Andersen's. ""They see it  and, thankfully, now welcome it  as a technical project. Or a marketing tool."" But the sun mirror, nonetheless, is art, he says. ""I don't know how exactly I'd define it,"" Larsen says. ""An installation? A sculpture? It makes me think about how we need the sun, what happens to light when you reflect it. But what's really special is that it goes so deep into the public sphere. It touches something absolutely fundamental in this town."" At high school in Rjukan, Larsen remembers ""walking down the street and looking up and seeing sunshine and blue sky and thinking: why can't I be there?"" In the end, he says, ""the only way to cope is to ignore that. To survive here in winter, you have to ignore the possibility of the sun."" But no longer. Now there's the Solspeil. ""A work of art,"" Larsen says, ""with a real, vital function, fulfilling a basic need in people's lives."" Down on the square, Ingunn Sparbo might not put it in quite those terms, but she can't agree more. ""Look at this!"" she says, almost beside herself. ""Who'd have thought it? I've stepped out to get a bit of sun."""
